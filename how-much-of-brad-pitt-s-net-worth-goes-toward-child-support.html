Stereotypes aside, what happens when super-rich people split and there are kids in the middle?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Specifically, what happened when <a href=#>$300M net worth Brad Pitt</a> and circa-2020 <a href=#>$100M net worth Angelina Jolie</a> split? And how does the child support for their six children add up?</p><h2 id=does-brad-pitt-pay-child-support>Does Brad Pitt Pay Child Support?</h2><p>Looking at the discrepancy between <a href=#><strong>Brad Pitt</strong></a>'s net worth and Angelina Jolie's total tally, it's clear who the courts would favor for child support. The thing is, who really needs child support when they're worth millions?</p><p>Apparently, Angelina does. Back in 2018, court documents <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">suggested</a> that Brad had paid more than $1.3 million in "bills for Jolie and their six children." This was after Jolie stated in court records that Brad neglected to pay "meaningful" support for the kids since their split.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Is Why Angelina Jolie Feared For Her Children's Life During Divorce With Brad Pitt</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brad's camp clearly didn't appreciate that allegation, with documents claiming that not only did Brad pay that hefty sum over the course of two years, but that he'd also lent Angelina $8 million to buy her home (where are her millions, though?). Some sources lump the amounts together, claiming Brad paid $9M in child support post-split.</p><p>But why does Brad Pitt pay so much child support? Those same court records suggest that he didn't; not really.</p><h2 id=brad-pitt-lent-angie-some-of-his-net-worth>Brad Pitt Lent Angie Some Of His Net Worth</h2><p>Those same court filings that state Brad Pitt paid millions in child support also show a clearer picture of how acrimonious the couple's split was. For one thing, the money that Brad lent Angelina was literally a loan; she has to pay it back with interest, noted Good Morning America.</p><p>What's more, the source alleged, Brad was apparently the reason Angelina and the kids had to move in the first place.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The record shows that Brad kept the family home, "including all of its contents," which meant Angelina Jolie (and their six children) had to find a new place to live separately from the actor. It definitely doesn't sound like Brad is handling his business when it comes to his kids, or at least, he wasn't in 2018. So what has happened since?</p><h2 id=how-much-of-brad-pitt-39-s-net-worth-goes-to-child-support>How Much Of Brad Pitt's Net Worth Goes To Child Support?</h2><p>$1.3 million sounds like a lot to most people, especially parents who are receiving very little -- if anything -- from their children's other parent/their former spouse. But in Brad and Angie terms? That $1.3M is almost pathetically low.</p><p>Consider that Brad is worth about $300M. The amount he claimed to pay over two years is something like .2 percent of his entire net worth. At that rate, he could pay child support until he's an actual 200-year-old vampire.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Has A Higher Net Worth In 2020: Jennifer Aniston Or Brad Pitt?</a></span></p><p>Yet Pitt's net worth may have <a href=#>dipped slightly following his split from Angelina</a>. Because although they separated years ago, their divorce has been a long, drawn-out, expensive affair. They shared many assets, Brad has had to pay for lawyers, and the child support issue still seems to be up in the air.</p><p>Total, though, Brad has probably lost around one percent of his massive net worth to date. What comes next, though?</p><h2 id=how-much-child-support-does-angelina-jolie-want>How Much Child Support Does Angelina Jolie Want?</h2><p>Though it seems Angelina's net worth has grown since she split from Brad Pitt, she's apparently still seeking some financial support from her ex. It's tough to pin down Angelina's asking price, but plenty of sources have some ideas on what kind of figures the Jolie-Pitts might be haggling over.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For one thing, in 2011, Forbes<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> that the Jolie-Pitt family spent $10 million per year on their children. The expenses for the then-school-age and under children (the six kids ranged from two to nine at the time) added up quickly.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans React To Brad Pitt Challenging Court Ruling In Favor Of Angelina Jolie Amid Custody Battle</a></span></p><p>Transportation (private jets, of course), private tutors and nannies, clothing, food, birthday parties, and hotel bills, among countless other expenses, amounted to a staggering $10 million for one calendar year. The thing is, that estimate was trotted out long before any of the kids went to college (Maddox is currently at university), and before Zahara and Shiloh had their respective surgeries and hospital care.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All told, it's reasonable to assume that raising the Jolie-Pitt kids takes far more than $10 million since they're older now. However, given the number of times Angelina and Brad have been to court over the years, fans can only assume that Brad isn't paying his share.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Here's How Brad Pitt Really Spends His $300 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIybqZqcXaW2tcCMp5ytZaekv7W0jJyfoqSUYsC2vM%2Boqa1n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
