Albeit, that loss was to the undisputed <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Floyd 'Money' Mayweather</a>, so the defeat is justifiable. Despite this loss being the only blemish on his boxing resume, it only proved the elite skill of the Mexican-born fighter and lined him up to dominate every other worthy contender that stood in his path. Beginning around the age of 13, Alvarez has pummelled through opponents like a battering ram, snatching the WBC, WBA, WBO, and IBF title belts in the process. For all this boxing success, one only has to wonder how the pound-for-pound king Canelo Alvarez spends his millions.</p><h2 id=the-spoils-of-boxing>The Spoils Of Boxing</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You don't have to go that far back in boxing history to see how much wealth some boxers have amassed in the ring. There's Mike Tyson, who was a prized fighter in his prime, now with a net worth of $10 million. Then there's the three-time heavyweight champion, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lennox Lewis, with a net worth of $140 million</a>. Anthony Joshua's net worth is $80 million, Manny Pacquiao's net worth is estimated at $220 million, and Floyd Mayweather's net worth is well over $1.2 billion.</p><p>There are numerous other professional boxers with impressive banknotes, but that's enough proof that it pays to throw a punch! Canelo Alvarez is no exception. In fact, he can be classed with the top-tier boxers with a net worth of $140 million. According to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes,</a> in 2021, he's been ranked #48 on the list of the <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">world's highest-paid athletes</a>. He also made a whopping $32 million from his fights with Callum Smith in 2020 and Avni Yildirim combined. Then in May of 2021, he walked away with $35 million from his match against British boxer Billy Joe Saunders. And with every fight, it seems to get better! His most recent fight in 2021 against the undisputed Caleb Plant earned him a purse of $40 million. And with the pedal to the metal, it's more than likely that Alvarez has no plans of stopping anytime soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=all-that-money-can-buy>All That Money Can Buy</h2><p>With all the hard work and the net worth to show for it, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Canelo has the cash to afford the finer things in life</a>. Although he keeps his living location private, the world got a preview of his lavish lifestyle after putting his mansion up for sale in 2015. The <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">11,970-square-foot home situated in Del Mar, San Diego, California</a>, was sold for $6 million. Lavish and fit for a king, the property boasted six bedrooms, high ceilings, elevated wooden beams over the living room, a game room with a built-in bar, and a magnificent ocean view to top it all off. But that's just the tip of the iceberg when taking into account the possessions under the Mexican superstar's belt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He may not be as flamboyant with his <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">car collection as Floyd Mayweather</a>, but he can boast a garage of luxurious <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">vehicles priced at $8.3 million</a>. Among those cars are a black series Mercedes SLS AMG estimated at $165,000. Next is a sportscar, known as the world's fastest road car, the Bugatti Chiron, worth $2.3 million and is able to reach a maximum speed of 261 mph. Next is the ultimate luxury car, a Rolls Royce Ghost, which Alvarez admits he rarely drives, priced at $2.4 million. Another one of his favorites is the Nissan GTR nicknamed Godzilla, which he purchased for $1.2 million. Followers on his social media would have also seen pictures of Canelo with his Ferrari Testarossa, Ferrari 458 Italia, Lamborghini Aventador, Lamborghini Gallardo, Mustang 500 Eleanor, Porsche 911 GT#, McLaren P1, and two Mercedes- Benz G63 AMG trucks. If one thing is for certain, it's that Canelo knows how to pamper himself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With such a <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">diverse collection of cars</a>, it's safe to say that Canelo has the plush land transportation aspect in check. To complement that, the boxing sensation also has in his possession a stunning <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$45 million black yacht</a> equipped with jet skis, a jetty, and a raft. The vessel, which was renamed "Canelo" from "Black Legend," was purchased shortly after signing an 11-fight $365 million deal with<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Oscar De La Hoya's</a> Golden Boy Promotions and DAZN. However, Canelo exited the deal in November 2020 to become a free agent. But that still didn't hinder the success of Canelo. In addition to his superyacht, he also owns a private jet with a price tag of $35 million, which he uses to travel across the country for fights and vacations.</p><p><span class=next-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Money Hits: The Story Of Floyd Mayweather</a></span></p><h2 id=the-smart-investments>The Smart Investments</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like most other financial giants in the boxing world, the Mexican stalwart doesn't depend solely on boxing to generate and maintain his wealth. <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He also made wise investments</a> into real estate in addition to endorsement deals he has been offered following his performance in the ring. A few of these sponsorships include Under Armor, Coppel Tecate, Hennessy, Everlast, and Golden Boy Promotions. In an interview with Graham Bensinger at his Guadalajara estate in Mexico, Canelo revealed his blueprint to arrive at<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> billionaire status</a>; one is investing in real estate, which he says earns him $1.6 million a month, or between $4 and $5 million every four months.</p><p>He also unmasked another <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">strategy for success in the interview</a> involving his own gas station stations. He said, "... I have enough, of course, to retire and have absolutely no problem. But I like boxing. And I am about to open 90 to 100 gas stations here in Mexico. They are gonna be called 'Canelo Energy.' But the business-savvy boxer isn't done there. He has already <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">established his own clothing brand</a> named Store Canelo, where he sells sportswear for men, women, and children. And as a free agent who is fiercely independent, he went ahead to establish his own boxing promotion company, which he calls Canelo Promotions. The company already has 100 young and talented Mexican fighters training in his camp.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Canelo, like <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Floyd Mayweather</a>, has shrewdly capitalized on the hard work and dedication it took to become a boxer of his stature by creating multiple streams of income. And he has done all this at the start of his 30s. He is a great example of what focus, drive, and determination can produce in a person's life, no matter where your journey begins in life.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>Manny Pacquiao Quits Boxing For A Rather Startling Reason</a></span></p><p>Season: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Essentially Sports,</a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes,</a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TalkSport,</a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Top Gear</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayersBio</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8Bmo6inm2K2r8DOZquhnV2hrre10qFkpaGWmsC1xcueZKieXaWBsXnKoqWgZZOWu6a4zmaYpa6Rp7K7ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
