News</a>, Hwang made his first public appearance yesterday following his arrest early the same morning. He entered a plea of not guilty. To secure the bail, the businessman agreed to forfeit $5 million in cash as well as two of his properties, including his personal residence.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Bhad Babie Is Making A Fortune On OnlyFans & Has Receipts</a></span></p><p>Hwang was instructed to hand over his passport to prevent him from travelling internationally. However, he said he recently lost it, so his wife agreed to provide&nbsp;hers instead.</p><p>Federal prosecutors confirmed yesterday that they arrested Hwang as well as Archegos’ Chief Financial Officer Patrick Halligan on criminal charges. The pair are accused of <a href=#>“manipulative trading” and “deceptive conduct”</a> after allegedly committing fraud.</p><p>Hwang and Halligan are facing a variety 11 criminal charges, including racketeering, market manipulation, securities fraud, and wire fraud.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We allege that these defendants and their co-conspirators lied to banks to obtain billions of dollars that they then used to inflate the stock price of a number of publicly-traded companies," Damian Williams, Manhattan U.S. attorney, explained in a statement to the media.</p><p>“The lies fed the inflation, and the inflation led to more lies. Round and round it went,” he continued.</p><p>Like Hwang, Halligan also pleaded not guilty to the charges and secured bail for himself. However, his bond was substantially lower at $1 million. Both men are set to return to court in lower Manhattan on May 19th.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hwang’s legal team has been vocal about the investor’s plans to fight the criminal charges, arguing the state doesn’t have enough evidence to back up their claims.</p><p>"We are extremely disappointed that the U.S. Attorney’s Office has seen fit to indict a case that has absolutely no factual or legal basis; a prosecution of this type, for open-market transactions, is unprecedented and threatens all investors," Hwang’s lawyer Lawrence Lustberg stated.</p><p>The attorney added that Hwang is “entirely innocent of any wrongdoing” and “there is no evidence whatsoever that he committed any kind of crime.”</p><p>Halligan’s lawyer, Mary Mulligan, echoed a similar sentiment, noting her client is "innocent and will be exonerated."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>ABC News</a> explains the pair’s criminal actions affected the stock prices of many companies, compromised the savings of employees, and left banks with billion-dollar loses.</p><p>However, it personally benefited Hwang and Halligan. Hwang’s net worth rose from $1.5 billion to $35 billion in one year due to the illicit activity, the publication notes. With a net worth like that, $100 million in bond money may not be such a big deal after all.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Betty White’s Mansion Is For Sale, But The Price Is No Joke</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Yahoo!
