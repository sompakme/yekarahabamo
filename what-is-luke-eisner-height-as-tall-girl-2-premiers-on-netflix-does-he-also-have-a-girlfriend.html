In an interview with Screen Rant Plus, he says he’s going to make some new friends.</p><p>He&nbsp;stated, “this was something I was considering. Stig, for one thing, does not primarily speak English. He moves to a new country, loses all of his friends, and is forced to live with the new boyfriend of the girl he had a crush on.”</p><p>When I see that, I think to myself, “Thank God his sister came.”</p><p>“He needed a reminder of who he was because he had completely lost track of himself when he was popular.</p><p>I believe it will be beneficial for Stig to try to make friends the right way, for who he is rather than just because he is the new guy. I really want that [for him]; he’s very special to me.”</p><p>Let’s watch the new season on Netflix to learn more about the story.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYlsFutdJmo66jlWKyqr%2FNnqlmoJWetKnAjJqqZqyRoblus8iro2ZqXaW%2FprnInqmsZZ%2Bjeq%2Bx05%2BjorBdmbymv4yhnGaZnKi8brTAr5xmmV2ctrO4xaugnqaUYraveZFpaWtlY2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
