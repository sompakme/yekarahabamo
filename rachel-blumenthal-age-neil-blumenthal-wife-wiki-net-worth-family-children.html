Rachel’s Family and Children<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Rachel has been married for over a decade. She and Neil tied the knot on 4th August 2008. They had met while they both were in college. Both of them studied at Tufts University and fell in love.</p><p>They got married after 15 years of dating. They recently celebrated their 11th anniversary.</p><p>Neil is the biggest supporter of Rachel. He is the co-founder and co-CEO of&nbsp;Warby Parker&nbsp;which is an online retailer of eyeglasses. He is a year younger than Rachel. The couple has always been together providing all the support they require. It was Neil who encouraged Rachel to start up her business.</p><p>They have 2 children together; Griffin who is 7 years old and studies in 3rd grade and Gemma is her 3-year-old daughter. She is in the pre-school. They live in Greenwich Valley, New York City. This adorable family enjoys each other’s company so much. Rachel is a working woman, yet she manages as much time as she can for her family.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=rachel-blumenthals-wiki></span>Rachel Blumenthal’s Wiki<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Rachel graduated from Tufts University in the early 2000s. Thereafter, she was offered a job of a financer, however, she rejected that job as that was not something she wanted to do.</p><p>Later, she worked at AOL, an American online service provider. But, even that job could not make her happy. Only after a few months at the job, she realized that she wanted to do something in the field of fashion, but on her own.</p><p>Again, she left her job and luckily found another one in&nbsp;Yves Saint Laurent. While working there, she decided to start her own business. She thus launched&nbsp;Rachel Leigh, a jewelry brand. This brand became popular among people in a short time.</p><p>After her hands in jewelry, she then founded&nbsp;Cricket’s Circle. This was an online site for babies. This site would help moms to know what they could buy for their babies.</p><p>And after all of these, she finally founded&nbsp;Rockets of Awesome&nbsp;in 2016. Since then she has been working for this and gaining a lot of popularities. She has even appeared in a lot of podcast interviews talking about motherhood.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-rachels-net-worth></span>What is Rachel’s Net worth?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>This businessperson has an economically balanced life.
