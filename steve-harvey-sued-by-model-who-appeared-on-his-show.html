She is also claiming that some of her photos were altered in order to make her look less demure.</p><p><strong>PREVIOUSLY: <a href=#>STEVE HARVEY&nbsp;MAKES HUGE MISTAKE AT MISS UNIVERSE PAGEANT</a></strong></p><p>Collier says that she was cast to appear on Harvey’s show after responding to a call for “single professional women who like to show off their looks.” She explained she was made to believe that the episode would depict a professional single mother who is also a fitness model, but that wasn’t what happened at all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In her suit, the model claims to have shown up wearing a&nbsp;long-sleeved blouse and pencil skirt but was made to change into a "halter top and&nbsp;form-fitting skirt." And according to documents obtained by TMZ, she also revealed that&nbsp;the audience voted on her looks during a segment of the show, with a section responding with the use of terms such as "whore," "slut," "ratchet," and "daddy issues."</p><p>That part wasn't aired, however, due to her sending&nbsp;in a&nbsp;cease and desist letter to the show to have the audience poll removed prior to its broadcast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Collier&nbsp;says that she felt degraded and even cried backstage when Harvey handed her the clothes and undergarments that she came wearing. She has declared she felt like she was sexually harassed and she's now seeking $2 million for her troubles.</p><p>To date, Harvey's reps - who have been contacted by TMZ - have declined comment on the matter. But some would say that it was about time the comedian got sued by a model after his blunder during the Miss Universe Pageant in 2015 when he named the wrong contestant as the winner.</p><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=#>TIMES STEVE HARVEY COMPLETELY LOST IT ON FAMILY FEUD</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5no6myt7GMoZirrpWuerTBxJ1km7FdorylsctmrqGnXZa9sbHAq5ydZZ%2Bjeqm10maqoaenZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
