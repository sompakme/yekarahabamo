He is the highest-paid MLB player of all time, with the highest salary in 2013 when he earned $28 million for one season. After his retirement in 2016, Rodriguez reinvented himself through his fashion and purchases to create a new identity. <a href=#>He stepped into the world of business ventures</a> to earn profit from his earnings. The former shortstop is the owner of A-Rod Corp, an investment firm, and the Chairman of Presidente, a beer company. He has amassed a $400 million fortune and loves to spend his money on buying the best.</p><p>Rodriguez is known for his highly publicized relationship with singer Jennifer Lopez and the lavish spendings he made via real estate, watches, and the most expensive cars.

He was photographed soaking the sun in St. Tropez in the South Of France on a 180-feet superyacht called the Ocean Paradise. The cost of the yacht is $32 million, and the weekly charter rate is $312,000.</p><p>As for his aviation journeys, A-Rod owns a Gulfstream VI SF that he purchased in 2017 by splashing out a whopping $4.2 million, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emirates 247</a>. The jet features a seating area for ten people, Wifi, fine dining, and high-tech surround sound systems. He is known to spend over 500 hours chartering his jet to travel around.</p><h2 id=an-epic-car-collection>An Epic Car Collection</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A-Rod is a <a href=#>car enthusiast and has been spotted driving around only the best</a>.

The Porsche set him back by over $100,000.</p><h2 id=expensive-watches-and-jewelry>Expensive Watches And Jewelry</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The biggest factor in <a href=#>Rodriguez’s transformation process</a> came from the noteworthy watch collection he purchased. A-Rod has a massive watch collection and only the best timepieces in his closet.

The 15-carat customized ring was the talk of the town after the engagement was announced publicly.</p><h2 id=fine-art>Fine Art</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Along with his epic car collection and sprawling properties, not many people know that A-Rod is a serious art collector. He has spent millions of dollars collecting art to decorate his beautiful homes. One of his favorite artists is Jean-Michel Basquiat, whose 1984 painting titled M.T has a grand spot at the entrance of his Florida home. The other collectible art is Self-Portrait in Mirror #1 (Raina), made in 2012 by Jonathan Horowitz, a New York-based artist, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Architectural Digest</a>.</p><p>He has also adorned his daughters Ella and Natasha’s rooms with fine art collectibles like Nate Lowman’s heart-shaped canvas in blue. His favorite artist is Andy Warhol, and he owns several pieces of the artist’s work. Rodriguez had plans to sell a major chunk of his collection for over $6 million to have a joint art collection <a href=#>with Jennifer Lopez</a>. However, he didn’t end up selling the work because of the split.</p><p>Alex Rodriguez has expensive tastes, and he treats himself to the best luxuries $400 million can buy. His spendings have ranged from the best car collections and jewelry to the most sought-after fine arts that adorn his homes. With his investment corporation finding momentum, his rising fortune&nbsp;may give rise to some more expensive purchases.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here's How Tennis Legend Rafael Nadal Spends His $200 Million Fortune</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Richest</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emirates 247</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swiss Watch Expo</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Architectural Digest</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSCbsPAsqpmmZyaxW6%2Bzp2pop%2Blmsduv8%2BepZ2rXZ22tHmTaWdmpZmhuaq7zWadqKqkqrumew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
