Over the years, DiCaprio has been linked to a series of interesting women, and most of them have been models. He definitely has a type— blonde, with legs for days, but then again, what man wouldn’t want to date a Victoria’s Secret model?!</p><p>While some celebs get a lot of flack for their relationships (*ahem, Taylor Swift*), others get a free pass, and DiCaprio is one of those people. Despite being linked to many women, some of which are reported to have even overlapped, no one gives the actor a hard time and perhaps, that’s because he doesn’t sing about his romances or speak about them in interviews at all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s no secret that DiCaprio has no trouble finding a date, but it seems he has less success in having a long-term relationship, although that doesn’t necessarily mean he doesn’t want one (he spoke about marriage in a 2016 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Parade</a>). Below are 15 catwalk queens and cover girls he’s been linked to over the years.</p><h2 id=bridget-hall-was-leo-s-first-model-love>Bridget Hall Was Leo's First Model Love</h2><p>Bridget Hall and Leonardo DiCaprio were linked in 1994. In this year, they were reportedly spotted a few times getting close in New York City, and although their romance was brief, there have been a lot of rumors about it and the reason for their split, some have even suggested that they didn’t last because they didn’t have the most passionate night together.</p><p>We can’t be sure of this, obviously, but what we do know is that there’s a lot more to Hall than her link to DiCaprio. She was one of the most popular models in the '90s and has worked for some of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">biggest brands in the world</a>, including Pepsi and Guess. She also landed high-profile modeling campaigns for fashion brands, Versace and Ralph Lauren, and has graced the covers of some of the world’s most <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">prestigious fashion magazines</a>. Yep, she definitely didn’t need DiCaprio to get people talking about her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=naomi-campbell-and-leo-decided-they-were-better-as-friends>Naomi Campbell And Leo Decided They Were Better As Friends</h2><p>Leonardo DiCaprio is rumored to have had a fling with the British supermodel,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Naomi Campbell</a>, back in 1995, it was reported to have only lasted a few months and, obviously, didn’t work out. What is interesting is that Campbell and DiCaprio have stayed friends and have been seen together platonically on multiple occasions, including charity events and vacations.</p><p>Campbell also dated one of DiCaprio’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">close friends, Vladimir Doronin</a>. But putting her dating life aside for a moment, Campbell is a lot more than a pretty face, and she's been working hard in the industry since she was 15, establishing herself as one of the world’s most recognizable models. She’s also used her fame as a platform for good and has been involved in several charities, including Breast Cancer Care and Whatever It Takes, as well as supporting the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation.</p><h2 id=gisele-b-ndchen-s-relationship-with-leo-was-actually-pretty-serious>Gisele Bündchen's Relationship With Leo Was Actually Pretty Serious</h2><p>Leonardo DiCaprio dated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gisele Bündchen</a>&nbsp;for five years starting in 2000, and they actually seemed like the perfect match because they both share a love for the environment and have the passion to help others. However, it was not to be and they called time on their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">romance in 2005</a>, and the following year she met her one-true-love, the NFL star, Tom Brady. The pair wed in 2009.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For those who don’t know, Bündchen is a Brazilian supermodel and one of the highest-paid models in the world, a far cry from her humble beginnings when she reportedly only owned one pair of jeans as a child. According to Fame10, she was scouted in McDonald's when she was a teenager, and by the age of 14, she moved away from home to San Paulo to try and make it big with an agency there.</p><h2 id=nina-agdal-is-quite-the-catch>Nina Agdal Is Quite The Catch</h2><p>This is a relationship that Leonardo DiCaprio never commented on publicly, but he and Nina Agdal were rumored to have dated for around a year from June of 2016 to May of 2017. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Daily News</a>, despite Agdal meeting DiCaprio’s mother on multiple occasions, their relationship wasn’t meant to be and they split amicably.</p><p>Agdal is a Danish model, who is well-known for her work with Sports Illustrated, as well as her Carl's Jr. Super Bowl commercial. Aside from her modeling work, she’s quirky and cool, and you’ll never find her dancing (according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo</a>, she said, "I don't like dancing. I'm like that awkward girl in the corner”).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her dating life has also gotten media interest because of her romance with Adam Levine. The pair reportedly hooked up when he was on a break from his now-wife, Behati Prinsloo, and their breakup made headlines because the singer is rumored to have told Agdal he was engaged to Prinsloo <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">via text</a>.</p><h2 id=erin-heatherton-s-busy-schedule-led-to-her-breakup>Erin Heatherton's Busy Schedule Led To Her Breakup</h2><p>In 2011, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Erin Heatherton</a> and Leonardo DiCaprio struck up a romance which lasted for ten months. They are rumored to have ended on good terms, with the reason for their split being down to busy schedules, which was actually believable because in addition to filming The Great Gatsby, DiCaprio had also been working on Django Unchained and the Wolf of Wall Street, so he was jet-setting across the globe. Heatherton, on the other hand, is a model who is in demand and has walked the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">runways of international designers</a>, as well as secured high-profile fashion campaigns.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2012, a source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a> that they had split several weeks before the media got wind of their breakup. Adding, "There's no bad blood— they still care about each other a lot." That’s good to know, but their relationship may not have worked out because of the big age difference—Heatherton is 14 years younger than the actor.</p><h2 id=toni-garrn-was-loving-it-up-with-leonardo-dicaprio-in-new-york-city>Toni Garrn Was Loving It Up With Leonardo DiCaprio In New York City</h2><p>In 2013, Leonardo DiCaprio was linked to the German model, Toni Garrn, and the pair&nbsp;was reported to have dated for a year before breaking up in 2014. The duo was spotted out in public <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">together on a few occasions</a>, including holding hands outside of a New York nightclub and attending the Unitas event, also in New York City.</p><p>There is speculation as to why they abruptly split, and it may have had something to do with another model, Katie Cleary (more on this below). There were also rumors that DiCaprio had been partying with 20 other women.</p><p>Garrn, who is 18 years younger than DiCaprio, is well-known for her work with Calvin Klein, the brand where she made her runway debut at the age of 13. She’s also covered issues of Vogue multiple times, and walked inVictoria’s Secret runway shows.</p><h2 id=his-romance-with-katie-cleary-raised-eyebrows>His Romance With Katie Cleary Raised Eyebrows</h2><p>Leonardo DiCaprio is reported to have gotten close to Katie Cleary during the Cannes Film Festival on May 19, 2014. Photos emerged of the pair, and it looked as though they were dancing together. DiCaprio was also seen whispering into Cleary’s ear, but there was just one problem; he was reportedly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">still dating Toni Garrn</a> at the time the pictures were taken.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like DiCaprio, Cleary also cares about the planet and is passionate about the rescue and rehabilitation of animals, especially. She is the founder of the animal welfare organization, “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Peace 4 Animals</a>,” and has raised thousands for causes she believes in.</p><p>In her professional life, she has worked as one of the Deal or No Deal girls, and has branched out as an actress and has worked on Rules of Engagement, Chuck, and Entourage.</p><h2 id=bar-refaeli-has-moved-on-from-leo-and-is-now-a-married-woman>Bar Refaeli Has Moved On From Leo And Is Now A Married Woman</h2><p>Leonardo DiCaprio was reportedly first linked to model <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bar Refaeli</a> in 2005, and they dated until 2009 before having a break. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PopSugar</a>, in 2010, Refaeli spoke about her six-month split from DiCaprio, saying, "It was a half year for which I am very grateful. I needed it. I came to understand a lot of things about myself. . . I worked on myself [and] I grew up…”</p><p>They called it quits for good in 2011.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Israeli model is considered one of the most internationally successful models (and it runs in her blood because her mother was also a model), and she is one of the most beloved Sports Illustrated stars. In 2013, she was reportedly named&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Israel’s highest-paid model</a>. Romantically, her life is also pretty great and after DiCaprio, she married the billionaire businessman, Adi Ezra, in 2015. The pair share two children, a daughter, Liv, who was born on Aug. 11, 2016, and a second daughter, Elle, who was born on Oct. 20, 2017.</p><h2 id=kelly-rohrbach-could-drown-her-sorrows-in-her-rising-career>Kelly Rohrbach Could Drown Her Sorrows In Her Rising Career</h2><p>Leonardo DiCaprio was spotted smooching Kelly Rohrbach while they rode bikes in New York City back in 2015. During the course of their relationship, they were seen packing on the PDA, and for a time, they looked to be very happy, but it was not meant to be, and they ended up calling time on their relationship in 2016.</p><p>Rohrbach didn’t lose too much sleep over the breakup though because she’s incredibly busy. In addition to appearing in the 2015 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, and being awarded the title of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rookie of the Year</a>&nbsp;(beating out six other models for the title), she has also tried her hand at acting. Rohrbach portrayed the character, C.J. Parker, in the film, Baywatch, in which she starred alongside Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Zac Efron.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eva-herzigova-is-said-to-have-romanced-leo-while-in-the-middle-of-a-divorce>Eva Herzigova Is Said To Have Romanced Leo While In The Middle Of A Divorce</h2><p>Leonardo DiCaprio and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eva Herzigova</a> are rumored to have met at the premiere of his 1998 film, The Man in the Iron Mask. Following this meeting, they allegedly had a month-long affair, but Herzigova was married to (and in the process of divorcing) the Bon Jovi drummer, Tico Torres, who she married in 1996.</p><p>The relationship didn’t last long, but that’s&nbsp;okay because Herzigova has gone on to find happiness with a longtime partner, an Italian businessman, Gregorio Marsiaj. Professionally, Herzigova, who is a Czech model, is known for being the original Wonderbra supermodel and in addition to modeling, she’s also an actress and has appeared in films, A Prominent Patient, and Cha Cha Cha. According to her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDB</a> profile, she has also worked as costume designer on the short film, Twisted Tango.</p><h2 id=lorena-rae-was-much-more-than-a-holiday-fling>Lorena Rae Was Much More Than A Holiday Fling</h2><p>In 2017, Leonardo DiCaprio and Lorena Rae made headlines after they were seen together in St. Tropez in July. They are reported to have met in Cannes and their rumored romance was more than a holiday fling because they were later seen together in New York City having dinner and enjoying Citi Bike rides around the city.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A source told People magazine that the pair were “not dating,” but there was definitely something going on between them.</p><p>The German model is only in her early twenties, but she has already <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">accomplished a lot professionally</a>, including becoming the face of Hugo Boss's eyewear campaign. She’s also a great person to follow on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, and in addition to her modeling shots and selfies, you can also get a feel for her personality because she posts pictures of herself posing with tortoises and snakes, and riding in helicopters.</p><h2 id=helena-christensen-and-leo-both-care-about-others>Helena Christensen And Leo Both Care About Others</h2><p>In 1997, following the success of the film, Titanic, every woman wanted to be with Leonardo DiCaprio and for a brief time, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Helena Christensen</a> may have been one of those women. According to People, DiCaprio celebrated his success with parties, and the Danish model was one of the women he is said to have partied with. They reported that he had “club-hopped” with her, as well as several other supermodels.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Christensen is one of the original Victoria’s Secret models, and she is a photographer now, but despite her success, she has chosen to live a very relaxed life. She told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Independent</a>, "I live a very low-key life. I still have the same car I had when I was 19. I just like things to be basically simple. I grew up in Denmark, being in nature, and I'm grateful for that."</p><p>She’s also a woman who cares deeply about others. She has worked with Oxfam, as well as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, since 2014.</p><h2 id=anne-vyalitsyna-s-love-often-makes-headlines>Anne Vyalitsyna's Love Often Makes Headlines</h2><p>After Leonardo DiCaprio and Bar Refaeli split, he was rumored to have dated the American-Russian model,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anne Vyalitsyna</a>, who is better known as Anne V. You probably recognize her name but not because of her romance with Leonardo DiCaprio, but rather, her relationship with Adam Levine (he even dedicated a song to her during a Victoria Secret fashion show).</p><p>It all worked out in the end for her though because in 2016 she became <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">engaged to the Yahoo! executive, Adam Cahan</a>. The pair also shares a daughter, Alaska.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Professionally, she has appeared in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue</a> (she debuted in 2005) more than ten times, she’s worked as a Victoria’s Secret angel, and even made her acting debut in a cameo in the 2013 film, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A Good Day to Die Hard</a>. Is there anything she can't do?!</p><h2 id=natasha-henstridge-was-the-it-model-of-the-90s>Natasha Henstridge Was The IT Model Of The '90s</h2><p>One of Leonardo DiCaprio’s lesser-known relationships is thought to have been with the Canadian model-actress,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Natasha Henstridge</a>, who he briefly had a fling with in 1997, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six </a>reported. While there’s no word on what went wrong, the&nbsp;two were only in their early twenties at the time, so it was unlikely that they were going to stay together forever.</p><p>Henstridge is known for her work as an actress rather than as a model, although, this is how she got her start. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zimbio</a>, when she was aged 13, she won as first runner-up at Casablanca Modeling Agency's "Look of the Year" contest. This competition seemed to open doors for her because she then went land the cover of the French Cosmopolitan when she was aged 16. Then in 1996, she starred as Sil in the action Sci-Fi film, Species, and later appeared in its sequel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=emma-miller-was-an-international-lover>Emma Miller Was An International Lover</h2><p>In 2009, Leonardo DiCaprio was reportedly linked to the British model, Emma Miller (who previously dated the actor, Jesse Metcalfe), and according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Glamour</a>, they were seen enjoying a dinner date in South Kensington. Whatever happened between these two was brief, but there was an eyewitness to their dinner date who told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Perez Hilton</a>, “The pair arrived separately and Leonardo was very keen not to be photographed. They left 10 minutes apart, and Leo then made his way to Maddox nightclub in Mayfair…”</p><p>Fast forward a few years and Miller is part of the Made In Chelsea cast. In addition to being a reality TV star, she’s also a fashion blogger, has worked in campaigns with high-profile designers and makeup brands, and according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hello</a> magazine, this all started when she was aged 16— she was scouted at the Birmingham Clothes Show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nYWp6o7HArquinqWheq67w56jrGWcmryvrdGdpmacmZiusb7IqGShmaNir6axzWajoqabmrFuwM5mpq%2BdomLBqbGMspyaqqNk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
