She’s just the best,” JP, 32, wrote via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> on Thursday, October 19, sharing a handful of photos with Ellen.</p><p class=p1>In the first photo, the firefighter and his girlfriend are all smiles at a party in <a href=#>coordinating patriotic outfits</a>. JP opted for a flag-inspired button-down while Ellen donned a “USA” tank and a pair of star-patterned denim shorts.</p><p class=p1>During JP’s appearance on <a href=#><i>Love Is Blind </i>season 5</a>, eagle-eyed viewers clocked that he only seemed to wear red, white and blue clothes or outfits with <a href=#>an American flag design</a>. His costars similarly took notice.</p><p class=p1>“I think some of the guys did [ask why he only wore patriotic outfits],” fellow season 5 star<a href=#><strong> Izzy Zapata</strong></a> noted during <a href=#>an October episode</a> of the “Viall Files” podcast. “I don’t think I ever saw him one time over there without something [featuring an] <a href=#>American flag or red, white and blue</a>. He just loves America, yeah. He [would say] like, ‘America, f—k yeah!’”</p><p class=p1>Other photos in the Thursday carousel featured JP and Ellen cuddling at <a href=#>a Houston Astros baseball game</a>, in a bowling alley and all dressed up (not in <a href=#>USA-inspired garb</a>) for a date night.</p><p class=p1>Izzy, 32, was the first one to reveal that JP was dating again after his split from costar<a href=#><strong> Taylor Rue</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Love-Is-Blinds-JP-Pierce-and-Girlfriend-Ellen-Hense-Go-Public-in-Coordinating-Patriotic-Outfits-02.jpg><p class=p1>“He’s a really good guy, like, I got to hang out with him one-on-one. I believe he’s been seeing a girl for a year now, so obviously he’s doing something right,” Izzy added on the October 5 podcast episode. “I think sometimes a lot of guys are not very in [touch] with their emotions or can’t express them very well and I think that was just the case with him.”</p><p class=p1>Inside <a href=#>the <i>Love Is Blind </i>season 5 pods</a>, JP connected with Taylor, 26, and proposed sight unseen. Their connection faltered once they met in person.</p><p class=p1>“The first time I realized it was at the reveal, but I tried not to think too much about that just because it’s the first time actually seeing each other,” Taylor <a href=#>exclusively told <i>Us Weekly</i></a> last month. “I was nervous. I know he was nervous, so I didn’t really dig too deep into that until Mexico.”</p><p class=p1>During their post-engagement trip to Mexico, JP made waves when he criticized Taylor for <a href=#>wearing too much makeup</a>. “I was really hurt and I was also confused,” Taylor told <i>Us</i>. “I was like, ‘There’s just no way that our relationship is basically ending because of the way I look.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Taylor and JP also struggled to communicate their feelings, which led Taylor to <a href=#>break off their engagement</a>.</p><p class=p1>“I left because the version of JP that I fell in love with was no longer there and that was scary to me,” she told <i>Us</i>. “I was supposed to go home and live with this person and I felt like I didn’t even know him in Mexico. So, I thought long and hard because part of me wanted to stay and part of me was like, ‘I’m done. I’m going home.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalp6aaeqq%2FjJujoqaUqHqrvIypoJ6qk5p6pbHBrqusZZ6axG6%2BzqaYp5uVYravec%2Baq6uhn6m2pHnOrqufoaSofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
