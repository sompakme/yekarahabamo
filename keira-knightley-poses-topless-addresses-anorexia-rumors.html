The Anna Karenina star also poses topless in the accompanying article.</p><p>“I’m quite rigorous about what gets exposed,” the British beauty says of appearing nude on film. “No bottom half! I don’t mind exposing my t-ts because they’re so small — people really aren’t that interested.”</p><p>As for deciding how much to show, Knightley says, “I think it’s much easier as you get older. You can say, ‘No.’ ‘Yes.’ ‘No.'”</p><p>Luckily, Knightley has a sense of humor about her smaller cup size — even when movie marketing executives try to enhance her bust. “They always pencil in my boobs. I was only angry when they were really droopy,” she laughs. “For King Arthur, for a poster, they gave me these really strange droopy t-ts. I thought, ‘Well, if you’re going to make me fantasy breasts, at least make perky breasts.'”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=640 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="keira knightley allure cover" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Knightley acknowledges that her body has always been under heavy scrutiny. In 2007, reports claimed the Pirates of the Caribbean actress suffered from an eating disorder. “The anorexic stuff — all of that — it’s always going to have an impact, so I think it did hit pretty hard. Because you go, ‘Oh, maybe that’s right!’ I knew I wasn’t anorexic, but maybe my&nbsp; body is somehow not right. Or my face is not right. Or the way I speak is not right,” she says. “When you’re going through a period where you’re really getting a lot of criticism, you go, ‘Maybe all this is right! You just kind of want to hide it all.'”</p><p>The Academy Award nominated actress — engaged to Klaxons keyboardist James Righton — found solace during a month-long sojourn through Europe. “I’d hit a wall and needed to step back in order to learn the things I needed to learn,” she tells <a href=#>Allure</a>. Despite her hardships, Knightley never lost sight of her dream. “There’s clearly something in me that goes, ‘No, actually, I know I’ve got something.'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGaknZmnrm63zaKeoaycmsZuvM6snKxlpKS9rbHSrGSbmaSpuaa%2FjJqlqKqVrbaiedGupKiqo2J%2FcX2RampqaV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
