But for most of us, who have to spend our days pondering over much lesser interesting stuff, taking a peek into celeb menus might not be a bad idea. After all, knowing the secret behind those slim and toned&nbsp;bodies&nbsp;is something that most of us are after.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These super cool celeb diets might come with questionable nutritional content, but we are not even going there. While we don’t recommend these diet plans for anyone, it's still interesting to find out which celebs eat or don't eat in order to lose weight. Enjoy the following 11 diets and decide for yourself which ones are crazy.</p><h2 id=reese-witherspoon---baby-food-diet>&nbsp;<strong>Reese Witherspoon -&nbsp;Baby Food Diet</strong></h2><p>Who would have guessed that jars of gooey bananas and mashed sweet potatoes would magically help shed those extra pounds? Apparently, <a title="Reese Witherspoon Net Worth" href=#>Reese Witherspoon</a> did and so did celebrity trainer Tracy Anderson whose Hollywood fitness studio promoted it. Although the actress never really admitted to this diet plan, it was reported that she was supplementing her breakfast and lunch with 14 baby food jars, which pretty much sums up the essence of the diet. Rumors have it that even Lady Gaga and <a title="Jennifer Aniston Net Worth" href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a> feature among the list of celeb fan followers of the Baby Food Diet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=nicole-snooki-polizzi---cookie-diet>&nbsp;<strong>Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi -&nbsp;Cookie Diet</strong></h2><p>Eat cookies and get thin. For those who are doubtful, we have our celeb backed proof of it. Jersey Shore reality star <a title="Nicole ‘Snooki’ Polizzi Net Worth" href=#>Snooki</a> told the Actress Hollywood, “I eat six cookies a day and then I have, like, chicken for dinner, or fish -- something healthy." This diet plan created by Dr. Siegal allows dieters to eat up to nine 60 calorie cookies a day. We have no idea how eating cookies might help in weight loss, but more importantly, these cookies come in a variety of flavors including chocolate chip and classic blueberry. Now, that’s interesting!</p><p></p><h2 id=megan-fox---apple-cider-vinegar-diet>&nbsp;<strong>Megan Fox -&nbsp;Apple Cider Vinegar Diet</strong></h2><p>As an actress, <a title="Megan Fox Net Worth" href=#>Megan Fox</a> believes that the vinegar helps her in losing water weight that gets retained in the body from menstruation and also improves her metabolism. She takes shots of the stuff for cleansing her system. The star reportedly said, “I'm not one for dieting or exercising, because I'm lazy and I have a really big sweet tooth, so I have to do cleanses every once in a while 'cause of the amount of sugar I take in.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=christina-aguilera---7-day-color-diet>&nbsp;<strong>Christina Aguilera -&nbsp;7-Day Color Diet</strong></h2><p>Adding more colors to your diet is a very healthy practice, but this ‘rainbow’ diet followed by singer <a title="Christina Aguilera Net Worth" href=#>Christina Aguilera</a> takes it to a whole new level. A namesake book by Mindy Weisel chalks out the diet plan which assigns its followers food of a particular color on a particular day. White is the color of the very first day followed by red, green, orange, purple and yellow before culminating in all the colors on the final day of the plan.</p><p></p><h2 id=beyonce-knowles---master-cleanse-diet>&nbsp;<strong>Beyonce Knowles -&nbsp;Master Cleanse diet</strong></h2><p><a title="Beyonce Net Worth" href=#>Beyonce</a>&nbsp;wanted to slim down for her role in Dreamgirls, her target being was to lose&nbsp;20 pounds in&nbsp;two weeks. So she turned to The Master Cleanse or starvation diet as some call it. While on this plan you can eat no solid food and need to thrive only on a mixture of maple syrup, cayenne pepper and lemon juice. She also had laxative tea at night and lukewarm water and salt every morning.</p><p></p><h2 id=adriana-lima---victoria-s-secret-diet>&nbsp;<strong>Adriana Lima -&nbsp;Victoria’s Secret Diet</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In one of the insanely scary diet plans out there, the Victoria’s Secret star <a title="Adriana Lima Net Worth" href=#>Adriana Lima</a> survives only on protein shakes mixed with powdered egg and water for nine whole days while working out once or even twice a day. This is part of her prep plan for the Victoria’s Secret annual fashion show. And this is just the beginning. Then just two days before taking on the ramp she stops drinking liquid altogether because she believes this helps in flushing the water out of her system. Lima told the Telegraph, “Sometimes you can lose up to eight pounds just from that.” While we don’t know about that, we are at least convinced that some secrets should remain a secret.</p><p></p><h2 id=lady-gaga---drunk-diet>&nbsp;<strong>Lady Gaga -&nbsp;Drunk Diet</strong></h2><p>Here’s to losing weight, wasted. <a title="Lady Gaga Net Worth" href=#>Lady Gaga</a> admitted to following the diet plan that was popularized by her ex-boyfriend Luc Carl. According to this plan she drinks whiskey while she works but also does her exercises even when struggling with a bad hangover. Many experts say she piled up 30lbs after following this plan. Our reaction?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=gwyneth-paltrow--macrobiotic-diet-and-goop-cleanse>&nbsp;<strong>Gwyneth Paltrow -Macrobiotic diet and GOOP Cleanse</strong></h2><p>Besides her fine acting skills, <a title="Gwyneth Paltrow Net Worth" href=#>Gwyneth Paltrow</a> is famously known for her many diet plans and rather weird lifestyle tips like steaming your privates. But we would rather talk about the diet. Her macrobiotic diet includes 100 percent natural food that has not been processed in any way. She refrains from eating meat, egg, fish or dairy. The GOOP cleanse, her other&nbsp;favorite, is a three-week detox plan that allows only one meal per day. Oh, and we can't forget that&nbsp;she chews&nbsp;13 times before she swallows.</p><p></p><h2 id=jennifer-lopez---grapefruit-oil-diet>&nbsp;<strong>Jennifer Lopez -&nbsp;Grapefruit Oil Diet</strong></h2><p>We don’t really know if this works as a weight loss agent, but <a title="Jennifer Lopez Net Worth" href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a> has been spotted carrying around a vial of grapefruit oil extract. She just smells the oil before each meal. Her logic? The aroma will help the liver enzymes function better and will facilitate weight loss. Whatever method JLo is using it seems to be working as her body has&nbsp;never looked better!</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=madonna---air-and-bacteria-diets>&nbsp;<strong>Madonna -&nbsp;Air and Bacteria Diets</strong></h2><p><a title="Madonna Net Worth" href=#>Madonna</a>’s Air Diet is not exactly what it sounds,&nbsp;it's even crazier that than. The diet involves cooking a dish and then resisting the urge to eat it. Yes, you read that right. On a more logical side is her Bacteria Diet created by her chef. It includes food that is rich in fiber content and is laced with ‘good bacteria’. She believes that the bacteria will not only prevent cancer, but will also promote food digestion and the growth of microbes.</p><p></p><h2 id=january-jones---placenta-pills>&nbsp;<strong>January Jones -&nbsp;Placenta Pills</strong></h2><p>As one of the hottest actresses in Hollywood, January Jones wanted to ensure she lost her baby weight as fast as possible. Now, her method for weight loss sounds crazy but tends to be more common than you would think. For <a title="January Jones Net Worth" href=#>Jones</a>&nbsp;it's all about&nbsp;placenta pills. Reports say that after giving birth, she had her placenta dried, crushed and put into capsules. She consumed one&nbsp;every day until the capsules ran out. Before you judge that one check it out, not only does it reportedly help shed weight but is also very healthy for you.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqaV2ks27Ax55kpqejqXqqutKapZ5lk5q5pq6MnaCerKNk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
