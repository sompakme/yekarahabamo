(Rachel is Raquel’s birth name.) “And he showed them to the cast, for what’s that worth.”</p><p>Nick further explained that while he “would have loved to sneak in a picture of [my fiancée] <strong>Natalie [Joy]</strong>,” Sandoval “went out of his way to bring in, like, endearing photos of him and Raquel/Rachel and show them around.”</p><p>News of<a href=#> Sandoval and Raquel’s affair</a> — which led to the end of his nine-year romance with <a href=#><strong>Ariana Madix</strong></a> — broke in March and <a href=#>the duo faced immediate backlash</a> from Vanderpump Rules castmates and fans alike. Ariana, for her part,<a href=#> didn’t mince words</a> when addressing her former friend during the three-part Vanderpump Rules season 10 reunion.</p><p>“F—k yourself with a f—king cheese grater. F—k you. You f—king suck,” Ariana, 38, told Raquel. “You are disgusting and I wish nothing but the worst s—t that can ever happen to a person on you.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Tom-Sandoval-Snuck-In-Photos-of-Raquel-Leviss-to-Special-Forces-According-to-Costar-Nick-Viall-3.jpg><p>Sandoval and Raquel went on to confess their love for each other during the tense cast get-together. Those feelings were something that Nick picked up on during his time with Sandoval on Special Forces.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“[Sandoval] came across as a guy who cared about her, and I’m just saying that objectively. Honestly, the conversations with the cast were kinda, like, ‘Well, f—k, you might as well go for it,’” Nick recalled on Thursday’s podcast. “There seemed to be some real reluctance about [whether] the public would allow them to be together, but he came across — to me — as someone who had feelings and cared about Rachel.”</p><p>After the reunion, Raquel sought treatment for mental health and has yet to sign on for<a href=#> season 11 of Vanderpump Rules</a>, which Sandoval is currently filming with his other costars.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuopV2orq%2Bwzq%2BYpWWimsOmrcusZLCgqWK1pnnSp6yco12eu26%2BwKqsnqRdpbakv4ytpmaroJqwqq3LZp2oqpOawHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
