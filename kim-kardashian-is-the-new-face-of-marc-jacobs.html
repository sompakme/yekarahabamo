It’s the first time that I’m really gonna be independent on doing any kind of fashion product.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p2><span class=s1>She continued, “I feel like I have a good pulse on what people want to wear and that’s a good thing to me, because not too long ago, I felt like I couldn’t even dress myself.”</span></p><p class=p4><span class=s1>For years, Kardashian was styled by ex-husband<a href=#><strong> Kanye West</strong></a>. Her newfound fashion independence sparked anxiety, which was documented in season 2 of The Kardashians. “Even now I’m having panic attacks like, what do I wear?” the SKKN by Kim founder explained during a May 2022 episode of the Hulu show. “Then for the Wall Street Journal magazine, I won the innovator award for Skims. And I was like, ‘How do I wear something that hasn’t been pre-vetted first?’”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Kim-Kardashian-New-Face-of-Marc-Jacobs-4.jpg><p class=p4><span class=s1>Despite the Dolce & Gabbana collection being a major victory for Kardashian, the project <a href=#>caused tension</a> between herself and sister <a href=#><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></a>.</span></p><p class=p4><span class=s1>During season 3 of The Kardashians, Kourtney, 44, revealed she was upset with Kim for planning a collaboration with Dolce & Gabbana that seemed to take inspiration from her and husband Travis Barker’s <a href=#>May 2022 nuptials</a>. Kim, for her part, argued that she tried to wait and she specifically didn’t choose items that Kourtney wore during her wedding weekend.</span></p><p class=p4><span class=s1>Kourtney in return asserted, “This is definitely not about a brand. It was about my wedding — I didn’t feel truly supported. It is like a free for all and there are no boundaries. It felt like there’s no decency to ask me how I felt about her doing this so close to my wedding.”</span></p><p class=p4><span class=s1>While Kim argued that she “shouldn’t have to ask for [Kourtney’s] permission,” she eventually apologized.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p4><span class=s1>Prior to Kim’s work with Dolce & Gabbana, she was tapped to be the face of Balenciaga in February 2022. Kim had been rocking head-to-toe Balenciaga ensembles for months before starring in the label’s ad and became synonymous with <a href=#>Balenciaga’s pantaboot</a>.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p4><span class=s1>Kim’s relationship with Balenciaga was later scrutinized after the company released a controversial spring/summer 2023 campaign in the fall of 2022 that featured children posing <a href=#>with BDSM-inspired teddy purses</a> and included a print out of a child pornography ruling.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p4><span class=s1>Kim <a href=#>condemned the ad</a>, sharing via Instagram in November 2022 that she was disturbed. “The safety of children must be held with the highest regard and any attempts to normalize child abuse of any kind should have no place in our society — period.”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p4><span class=s1>She doubled down on her stance during a December 2022 episode of the “Angie Martinez IRL” podcast, saying, “I completely denounced it.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p4><span class=s1>Balenciaga’s creative director, <strong>Demna</strong>, <a href=#>broke his silence</a> on the issue that same month, explaining, “I want to personally apologize for the wrong artistic choice of concept for the gifting campaign with the kids.
