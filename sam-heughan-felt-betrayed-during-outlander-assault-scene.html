Creative conversations are a feature of all productions, good art is made by questioning the truth and we all want to get it right.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sam-Heughan-Claims-Outlander-Producers-Betrayed-His-Trust-During-Season-1s-Sexual-Assault-Scene-Inline.jpg><p class=p1>During the season one finale of&nbsp;<i>Outlander,&nbsp;</i>Jamie was brutally raped by rival Black Jack Randall (played by <a href=#><strong>Tobias Menzies</strong></a>). The scene, which aired in May 2015, featured Black Jack assaulting Jamie in the shadows of their prison cell. Heughan and <a href=#>the&nbsp;<i>Crown&nbsp;</i>alum</a>, 48, were <a href=#>only naked at the end of the clip</a> — which had allegedly been reworked during the editing process.</p><p class=p1>“It would have been handled differently [if it was filmed today],” the&nbsp;<i>Men In Kilts&nbsp;</i>alum wrote, claiming <a href=#>a full-frontal shot was filmed</a>. “Times have changed. The [penis] shot was unnecessary and did betray my trust in the creative team a bit. We don’t need to see the horror to imagine what the characters go through. Imagination is way more powerful.”</p><p class=p1>Neither the&nbsp;<i>Outlander&nbsp;</i>creative team nor STARZ have publicly addressed Heughan’s claims, which were published in his memoir that was released on Tuesday, October 25. The&nbsp;<i>A Princess for Christmas&nbsp;</i>actor&nbsp;has previously been outspoken about <a href=#>being uncomfortable during explicit</a>&nbsp;<i>Outlander&nbsp;</i>scenes, leading him to<a href=#> hire an intimacy coordinator</a> for season 6.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sam-Heughan-Claims-Outlander-Producers-Betrayed-His-Trust-During-Season-1s-Sexual-Assault-Scene-Feature.jpg><p class=p1>“I brought on board the intimacy advisor <strong>Vanessa Coffey</strong> because, with intimate scenes, it’s important that everyone is protected, but also we find a way to explore these scenes and actually maybe get something more out of them,” Heughan&nbsp;said during a March appearance on the <a href=#>“Happy Sad Confused”</a> podcast. “I think this season we’ve done an even better job with those types of scenes because she really helped us understand what we are doing and how we build up this relationship and take it somewhere else, so she’s been terrific.”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Bloodshot&nbsp;</i>actor&nbsp;told host <strong>Josh Horowitz</strong> that <a href=#>the time-traveling period drama</a> started in a “very different time” when the industry was also different.&nbsp;“We really didn’t know what we were doing,” he added. “We were thrown in the deep end and had to learn through the experience, so I think it’s been really great to bring Vanessa on board to help younger actors with less experience.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><i>Outlander&nbsp;</i>— which was <a href=#>adapted from <strong>Diana Gabaldon</strong>’s bestselling novels</a> — is gearing up to return for its seventh season though a premiere date has not been announced.</p><p class=p1>“This really is [a] super-sized season,” Heughan <a href=#>exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>in June</a>. “We really start off with a bang. The first couple episodes are really strong, and that’s as far as we’ve got shooting-wise. But I know there’s so much that we are still about to get to. Not only that you’ve got a lot of new characters coming in or characters that I think are anticipated by fans — including, of course, Jamie Fraser’s son — but a bunch of new characters as well.”</p><p class=p1><i>If you or someone you know are experiencing domestic violence, please call the&nbsp;<a href=#>National Domestic Violence Hotline</a> at 1-800-799-7233 for confidential support.&nbsp;</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasmZ1itabBxqGYp2WWmrm1ecGeq6uZqZqxbrDUq6Cnn12kwrW4wKebnqpdlsC0rdSlq2ark5q7pns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
