She believes in open communication, shared responsibilities, and the absence of stereotypical roles within a relationship. She believes that relationships should come easy, with implicit understanding and without the need for explicit conversation, is fundamentally flawed.

She devised a new term to describe her state of mind: "self-partnered." Rather than focusing on the absence of a romantic partner, Watson's philosophy highlights the importance of self-awareness and individual growth. She has debunked the societal norm that being single equates to unhappiness. Instead, she has embraced her single status, demonstrating that fulfilment and contentment can come from within, stating, "I'm very happy [being single]. I call it being self-partnered."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/1-10.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite her comfort with singlehood, Watson is not averse to dating.
