Now married with a baby on the way, the mega-couple is once again in the news. However, before <a href=#>Kardashian and Barker had an Italian </a>wedding and added a baby to the blended family, the couple made news when they shared they didn't live together, despite being married. <a href=#>Kourtney Kardashian's fortune is vast</a> but she wasn't ready to splash it on a new home. She said on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Not Skinny, Not Fat"</a> podcast that she and Barker didn't want to disrupt their kids' home lives by selling a family home and buying a new one. She said,&nbsp;“We want our kids to also feel really comfortable and they have both lived in their homes their whole lives for the most part, and they each have their rooms and we are a block away."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In October 2023, however, Kardashian and Barker finally came together and bought a home that was theirs as a couple. And as expected, the multi-million-dollar California home is lavish, impeccable, and totally their style.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Kourtney Kardashian’s Wedding Dress Was Surprisingly Inexpensive</a></span></p><h2 id=all-about-the-santa-barbara-home>All About The Santa Barbara Home</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">US Magazine</a> shared that Kardashian and Barker bought an oceanfront property on Carpinteria Beach from comedian Conan O'Brien back in&nbsp;the fall for $14.5 million. While it's not one of the most <a href=#>expensive homes the Kardashians own</a>, it's the perfect bungalow for the couple. At 2,100 square feet, there's not much room for the couple and their collective six (soon to be seven) kids, but it's the perfect spot for a quiet getaway.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The&nbsp;hideaway&nbsp;home has private stairs that lead right to the beach, with a side deck for entertaining. Sitting on just under an acre, this beach bungalow doesn't need a massive lot because of the&nbsp;home's proximity to the 50 feet of beach in front, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dirt</a>. With a gated driveway, the home also has a detached guest house with two bedrooms, a kitchenette, a bathroom, and a wraparound porch. With palm trees covering the property and the ocean in the backyard, it's hard to imagine what the inside has in store...</p><h2 id=a-kardashian-barker-oasis>A Kardashian-Barker Oasis</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the outside looks like an average California beach shack, the inside is beautiful, clean, and filled with natural light. With four bedrooms and three and a half baths, Kardashian and <a href=#>Barker's new expensive home</a> is bright and airy. The kitchen and living room open into the same space, with the kitchen having stainless steel appliances and granite countertops. The hardwood floors match the cabinetry perfectly before opening into the living room, which has floor-to-ceiling windows to give premium views of the ocean. The living room also opens up to the side deck, which has a long dining table for beachside eating.</p><p>Thanks to the photos from Dirt, the white and brown furnishings make the space a cozy home away from home. Like the kitchen, the bathrooms also have granite tops with wide windows overlooking beautiful greenery and palm trees. And while Kardashian and Barker haven't shown off the improvements they made to the home or their interior design efforts on social media, the beachside home is their little oasis.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here's How Travis Barker Built His $50 Million Fortune</a></span></p><h2 id=a-special-place-for-kardashian-amp-barker>A Special Place For Kardashian&nbsp;& Barker</h2><p>Carpinteria Beach is one of the beaches in Santa Barbara, a town that's special to both Kardashian and Barker. As seen on Hulu's&nbsp;The Kardashians, Barker chose a Santa Barabra beach to propose to Kardashian&nbsp;in October 2021. While staying at Rosewood's Miramar Beach hotel, Barker and Kardashian took a stroll down the beach where Barker proposed surrounded by thousands of roses. The <a href=#>engagement was, of course, shown on The Kardashians</a><i>.&nbsp;</i>That following May, the couple chose Santa Barbara, yet again, as the place they'd legally marry. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a> shared the two went to Santa Barbara's courthouse and married quietly with Kardashian's grandmother and Barker's father as the witness. It seems only fitting that the two bought a home in a town that is special to them around the anniversary of their engagement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now that the two are official residents of Santa Barbara, they're in good company. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dirt</a> shared that Kardashian and Barker's new neighbors are none other than&nbsp;Star Wars director George Lucas, actors (and husband and wife duo) Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis, and&nbsp;Yellowstone's Kevin Costner. Between the famous neighbors who, presumably, are fun to live&nbsp;next to and the ocean as the central view for the house, Kardashian and Barker's Santa Barbara beach home is the perfect place to hide away in the summer months and get some alone time outside of hustle and bustle of Los Angeles photographers.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>Travis Barker Surprises Kourtney Kardashian With $160,000 Birthday Gift</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo!
