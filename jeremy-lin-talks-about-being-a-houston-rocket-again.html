I still have to kind of remind myself that this is all actually happening, sometimes. But it’s a huge blessing. I can’t believe how it all shaped up and for me to be here right now. I’m definitely excited and thankful.”</p><p>While the baller is excited for what the Rockets have to offer, according to SI.com, he honestly preferred New York at first.</p><p>“Before July 1, I didn’t even know what teams were interested in me,” he said. “But all I was hearing was, ‘You’re going back to New York.’ At that time, before free agency started, I preferred New York. By the time it came to the offer sheet, I was just excited about both opportunities.”</p><p>Overall, he’s ready for the change and reflects on the past year as a learning experience, preparing him for what’s ahead.</p><p>“This past year, it took me by surprise and it was just this huge storm,” Lin said. “It was kind of baptism by fire. You get thrown into it and you’ve just got to make adjustments and learn. That’s a lot of what I had to do.”</p><p>Click here to check out footage from the press conference over at <a href=# rel=nofollow>ESPN</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5%2Bys7HMsmSloZ5iwaK4yqxkmpqfqsFursSipaBlmKTCtMDOp2Srp5OgsrV5wKCYoqZdZn11hJVtZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
