On December 23, 2022 she wrote an investigative article on Donald Trump about his final campaign. In the article she quoted several anonymous sources who gave an insight on the politician’s post-Presidency life and commented on his bid to run for the White House once again.</p><p>In the report she alleged that a former White House official and Trump loyalist told her that Trump was an “isolated figure” who did not want to run for the White House, but announced his bid to “prove the haters wrong.”</p><p>Other sources allegedly claimed that trump mostly stays in his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, and only leaves home to play golf at his club in Doral.</p><p>“He just goes, plays golf, comes back, and f***s off. He has retreated to the golf course and to Mar-a-Lago. His world has gotten much smaller. His world is so, so small.”</p><p>She also wrote that an advisor who works on Trump’s ongoing campaign allegedly told her that the politician’s appeal was “gone” and that he cannot get it back in the future:</p><p>“It’s not there. In this business, you can have it and have it so hot and it can go overnight and it’s gone and you can’t get it back. I think we’re just seeing it’s gone. The magic is gone.”</p><p>In the article, she said that she spoke with Donald Trump in an interview but he allegedly denied all claims made by the insiders.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=donald-trump-response></span>Donald Trump Response<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Donald Trump made a response about the article claiming it was all fake and termed Nuzzi’s sources as non-existence.</p><p>“The Fake & Corrupt News is only getting worse! As an example, I agreed to do a short telephone interview for a once very good, but now on its “last legs” and failing, New York Magazine. The reporter was a shaky & unattractive wack job, known as “tough” but dumb as a rock, who actually wrote a decent story about me a long time ago. Her name, Olivia Nuzzi. Anyway, the story was Fake News, her “anonymous sources” don’t exist (true with many writers), and I’m happily fighting hard for our GREAT USA!”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=olivia-nuzzi-salary></span>Olivia Nuzzi Salary<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Her annual base salary is estimated to be $87,456.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=olivia-nuzzi-net-worth></span>Olivia Nuzzi Net worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She has an estimated net worth of $1.5 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4ynnLBlqaS%2FrHnMmp6aspmjsm6%2BxKmmq6yVp3qwuMivoJplnqrHu7WMoqpmq5iaeq6t0augnpxdZ3w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
