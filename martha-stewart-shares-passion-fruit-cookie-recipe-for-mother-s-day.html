The lifestyle maven, who recently partnered with MSC Cruises to create exclusive menus and shore excursions, is sharing her scrumptious passion fruit cookie recipe with Us Weekly just ahead of Mother’s Day on Sunday, May 12.</p><p>The treats, which are also known as Melting Moments, are popular at cafes in Australia and New Zealand. Though they earned such a moniker because of how they literally melt in your mouth when you eat them, they can also be called cornstarch cookies or custard kisses.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Martha-Stewart-dessert-recipes.jpg><p>Typically, these tasty confections can be made in a variety of flavors, but Stewart, 77, opts to fill hers with homemade passion fruit curd. “These Meltaway cookies melt in your mouth when you bite them. We fill them with passion fruit curd, rather than with traditional flavors like vanilla or raspberry,” Stewart tells Us. “This recipe also requires part flour and part cornstarch, creating a cookie with the perfect crumb – one that doesn’t fall apart when bitten.”</p><p>The passion fruit flavor is “tart, bright, cheery and refreshing,” according to the Martha Bakes host, which makes these cookies “worthy of being served on any occasion or at any celebration, especially in the spring and summer months.”</p><p>Adds the Martha & Snoop’s Potluck Dinner Party cohost: “They are also a perfect <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a> for mothers with a sweet tooth.”</p><p>Check out the recipe below!</p><p><strong>Passion Fruit Melting Moments</strong></p><p>Makes 24 servings</p><p>INGREDIENTS:</p><p>For the cookies:<br>• 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature<br>• 1/2 cup confectioners’ sugar, plus more for dusting<br>• 1 tbsp pure vanilla extract<br>• 1 1/4 cups unbleached, all-purpose flour<br>• 1/4 cup cornstarch<br>• 1/2 tsp kosher salt</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>For the filling:<br>• 4 large egg yolks, room temperature<br>• 1/2 cup frozen passion fruit puree, defrosted<br>• 1/2 cup granulated sugar<br>• 1/2 tsp kosher salt<br>• 5 tbsps unsalted butter, chilled<br>• 1 tsp unflavored gelatin</p><p>INSTRUCTIONS:</p><li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line two baking sheets with parchment.</li><li>In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix together butter, confectioners’ sugar and vanilla on medium-high speed, scraping down sides as necessary, until fluffy, about two minutes.</li><li>Sift together flour and cornstarch, then add to butter mixture along with salt, beating until just combined. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for one hour.</li><li>Measure two teaspoons of dough and form into a ball; transfer to prepared baking sheets. Repeat with remaining dough, spacing about one inch apart. Use a fork to make a three-prong indent on tops of balls.</li><li>Bake until slightly golden around edges, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer baking sheets to a wire rack and let cool completely.</li><li>To make the filling, heat egg yolks, passion fruit, granulated sugar and salt in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes.</li><li>Stir in butter and gelatin and mix until the butter has melted and the gelatin has dissolved. Strain curd into a medium bowl, then place plastic wrap directly onto surface; refrigerate until set, at least one hour.</li><li>Spread one scant teaspoon of curd on each of the bottom halves of the cookies. Dust remaining cookies with confectioners’ sugar; sandwich halves together.</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZqaZoqm1onnSrZywmaKperS0wKucrGWglsC0tc6nZJ%2BqpZ7Bbq%2FOqKKinV2nsqS1z55kn6eiYrqwwMeeqaxllJbGcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
