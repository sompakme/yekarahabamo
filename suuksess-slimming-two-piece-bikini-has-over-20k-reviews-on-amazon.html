They tend to show more skin, and it can be more difficult to find one that offers a slimming look. Luckily, we know which details to watch out for when shopping for a bikini to feel fabulous in! Personally, we love any set that includes high-waisted bottoms — if the top is equally flattering, we’re completely on board.</p><p>Checking out what customers have to say about swimsuits is also crucial, especially while shopping online. We take notice when a set soars in popularity, which is what brought our attention to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">this bikini from SUUKSESS</a>! It has over 20,000 reviews, and shoppers are completely head over heels in love with it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/SUUKSESS-Womens-Wrap-High-Waisted-Bikini-Set.png><p><strong>Get the <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">SUUKSESS Women’s Wrap High Waisted Bikini Set</a> for prices starting at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$31</a> at Amazon!

The ruching helps smooth out the belly, which many shoppers are thrilled with. Additionally, the higher hem of the bottoms can also make your waist look more streamlined, which is always a bonus!</p><p>The top teamed with the bottoms proves that this set is a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">match made in swimsuit heaven</a>. It’s a wrap-style option that accentuates the bust and includes straps that wrap around the top of the waist.
