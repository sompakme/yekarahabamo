The pair met while filming Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and though he was still married to Jen, Brad and Angelina’s romance seemed to start on set. They went public with their romance as soon as the news of his divorce from Jen in 2005 made headlines.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/despite-being-anti-plastic-surgery-jennifer-aniston-has-gotten-these-procedures-2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Despite Being Anti-Plastic Surgery, Jennifer Aniston Has Gotten These Procedures</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Jennifer Aniston has spoken out many times against plastic surgery, but she actually has a couple of procedures under her belt.</span><p>While Jen says having kids just wasn’t in the cards for her, Brad is reportedly hoping to expand his family even further, as <a href=#>he apparently wants kids with his younger girlfriend</a> Ines De Ramon.
