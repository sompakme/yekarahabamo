Yes, yes I am</a>.” “When you love your son’s stepmom,” Miranda captioned the post.</p><p>Even as early as 2017, Miranda said her son got on well with Orlando’s new girlfriend. “<a href=#>Yeah, they’re great</a>,” Miranda told Vogue UK. “They get along really well.”</p><p>Katy has also gushed over Miranda.
