Not only is she a massive Bollywood actress and singer, but her recent works in the United States have made her quite the staple figure in pop culture.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From her most known works such as 'Quantico', 'Baywatch', and 'Isn't It Romantic', Priyanka has made a name for herself and isn't going anywhere anytime soon. In addition to her lengthy resume, the star recently married singer Nick Jonas, and the two have become the "it" couple ever since.</p><p>While she may have only recently broken out in American films, she has managed to become close with a number of high profile celebrities! In addition to making loads of friends, the actress has also found herself staying away from certain stars. Here are 10 celebs that are close to Priyanka, and 10 that she chooses to stay away from.</p><h2 id=adam-devine---on-screen-romance-to-off-screen-friendship><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>Adam Devine - On-Screen Romance To Off-Screen Friendship</span></h2><p>Priyanka Chopra starred in the 2019 film 'Isn't It Romantic'. The actress had a pretty significant role in the film and played Adam Devine's characters' love interest. The two hit it off instantly and moved their on-screen romance into an off-screen friendship that we can all get behind.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=johanna-braddy---keeping-it-friendly><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>Johanna Braddy - Keeping It Friendly</span></h2><p>Johanna Braddy and Priyanka Chopra both starred on the hit show 'Quantico' together. The show was on air for over three years, so it is no surprise that she and her closest co-star became the best of friends. The two remain close to this day, despite the show ending, and make it clear that their friendship isn't going anywhere.</p><h2 id=lilly-singh---girl-power><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>Lilly Singh - Girl Power</span></h2><p>In the world of Hollywood, being an Indian woman makes things hard in order to reach high profile status, however, power duo Lilly Singh and Priyanka Chopra are proving otherwise and shutting down these silly and made-up rules. These twos friendship is one we absolutely love, and hope continues on for quite some time.</p><h2 id=madhu-chopra---family-over-everything><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Madhu Chopra - Family Over Everything</span></h2><p>Priyanka Chopra, who was born in Jamshedpur, India, frequently visits her family back home! When it comes to Priyanka, her family is absolutely the most important thing in her life. The star posted this shot of her visiting her mom back in New Dehli and we are loving every bit of this mother-daughter love.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=milo-ventimiglia---supportive-of-one-another><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Milo Ventimiglia - Supportive Of One Another</span></h2><p>Milo Ventimiglia is quite the stud, however, it appears Nick Jonas doesn't mind one bit that he and Priyanka are close buds! The two have appeared in numerous short films and videos together, including Milo's cameo in one of Priyanka's music video for 'I Can't Make You Love Me'. Milo had nothing but great things to say about Chopra, claiming he could have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fallen in love with her.&nbsp;</a></p><h2 id=nick-jonas---hubby-has-her-back><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Nick Jonas - Hubby Has Her Back</span></h2><p>When it comes to Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas' relationship, this is one for the books! The two are very clearly in love, and it doesn't look like things are changing anytime soon. The two have the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">greatest of relationships</a> and prove that true love does still exist! While they may seem picture-perfect, Priyanka admitted that she and Nick fight just like everyone else does.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dwayne-johnson---always-makes-her-smile><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Dwayne Johnson - Always Makes Her Smile</span></h2><p>Priyanka and Dwayne Johnson starred in 'Baywatch' together! This was Priyanka's first time playing a villain in an American film. While she comes across as a sweetheart in real life, she really sold the role in this movie. The two became close during the filming of the show, and Dwayne just so happens to be good buds with Chopra's hubby, Nick Jonas too!</p><h2 id=rebel-wilson---colleague-to-friends><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Rebel Wilson - Colleague To Friends</span></h2><p>When it was revealed that Rebel Wilson would be starring alongside Priyanka Chopra, we knew we were in for a wonderful ride. The two starred in Wilson's film 'Isn't It Romantic', and become quite the duo during the film's press tour. The two have remained friends since and always have the best things to say about one another.</p><h2 id=zac-efron---they-keep-it-real><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Zac Efron - They Keep It Real</span></h2><p>Much like 'The Rock', Priyanka has also built quite a nice friendship with her other 'Baywatch' co-star, Zac Efron. For one, Priyanka is easily one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood, and Zac Efron, is well, Zac Efron. With that being said, it's only fitting that these two built a nice relationship after the film had wrapped.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sophie-turner---sisterly-love><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Sophie Turner - Sisterly Love</span></h2><p>Priyanka Chopra didn't only marry Nick Jonas, but she married the whole family! While she's got a great relationship with brother-in-law, Joe, she has an even better one with Sophie Turner! The two are always seen having the best time, and it's clear that their bond is without a doubt real and authentic.</p><h2 id=delta-goodrem---petty-comments><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Delta Goodrem - Petty Comments</span></h2><p>When it comes to people that Priyanka isn't a fan of, a few of Nick Jonas' ex-girlfriends come to mind, including Delta Goodrem. The Australian singer dated Nick for quite some time a few years back, however, when asked about his marriage to Priyanka, Delta didn't have the nicest things to say.</p><h2 id=meghan-markle---cut-out-for-good><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Meghan Markle - Cut Out For Good</span></h2><p>Priyanka and Meghan Markle were partners in crime! It goes without saying that Priyanka was Meghan's ride or die, however, things took a turn when Markle gained royal status. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mirror,</a> Meghan did not attend Priyanka's wedding to Nick Jonas, and the two had a falling out after she got caught up with her new royal lifestyle. Ouch!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=miley-cyrus---instagram-shade><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Miley Cyrus - Instagram Shade</span></h2><p>While Priyanka Chopra is not one to shade anyone, it appears she did so on a Miley Cyrus Instagram photo. After Miley posted a few shots of her and Nick from way back, Priyanka commented on the photo saying "My hubby is right, these are fire". Fans immediately thought that Priyanka was dangling the fact that she ended up with Nick and not Miley in the comments, stirring up some drama between the two.</p><h2 id=olivia-culpo---leave-the-baggage-behind><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Olivia Culpo - Leave The Baggage Behind</span></h2><p>Much like a few other past girlfriends Nick Jonas had, Olivia Culpo is also not going to be having coffee with Priyanka anytime soon. Olivia was Nick's last girlfriend prior to him meeting and marrying Chopra, making things quite awkward between the two. Exes are tricky, so we don't blame Priyanka for keeping her distance.</p><h2 id=salman-khan---shady-comments><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Salman Khan - Shady Comments</span></h2><p>For those of you who may not be familiar with actor Salman Khan, he and Priyanka have starred in Bollywood films together. The Indian actor has gone on to make some pretty nasty comments regarding Priyanka after working on 'Bharat', and she certainly didn't go down without a fight!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=selena-gomez---breakup-beef><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Selena Gomez - Breakup Beef</span></h2><p>Selena Gomez was one of Nick Jonas' most high profile relationships. The two dated in the late 2000s and made headline news after their split. When it comes to past relationships, we don't see why Priyanka has to be nice! It's clear that Nick and Selena didn't end off on a great note, so it's easy to understand why Priyanka wouldn't want to be friendly.</p><h2 id=wendy-williams---always-takes-it-too-far><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Wendy Williams - Always Takes It Too Far</span></h2><p>Although Priyanka has appeared on the 'Wendy Williams Show' in the past, we don't think she'll be making a visit anytime soon. Wendy Williams is known for making pretty shady comments, and she didn't fall short when it came to Priyanka. The talk show host called Priyanka out for being "too beautiful", and essentially told her to keep quiet after Priyanka says even she "has flaws".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tom-hiddleston---no-exes-allowed><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Tom Hiddleston -&nbsp;No Exes Allowed</span></h2><p>While a lot of Nick Jonas' exes are on this list, we couldn't help but add one of Priyanka's too! The actress allegedly dated Tom after his split from Taylor Swift, and the two dated privately for a few months then after. They even graced the stage together and had very good chemistry. While they made a great team, things didn't end well, and a lot of drama surrounded their relationship.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift---music-video-shade><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Taylor Swift - Music Video Shade</span></h2><p>When it came to Tom Hiddleston and Priyanka Chopra's rocky relationship, Taylor Swift has managed to find herself in the middle. Swift, who wasn't too happy to find out that her ex left her for Priyanka, allegedly shaded the Bollywood actress in her music video for 'Look What You Made Me Do'.</p><h2 id=danielle-jonas---trouble-in-the-family><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Danielle Jonas - Trouble In The Family</span></h2><p>Although family is everything for Priyanka, it appears she and sister-in-law don't get along the greatest. Reports have claimed that Danielle wasn't very welcoming of Priyanka, and gave her the cold shoulder when she married into the Jonas circle. While Danielle is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"so over"</a> being asked about the situation, we can't imagine things being all that great right now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhoaWWTmrmmrtJmrqGnXZa%2FpnnPmqmtZZ%2BberG%2ByLKYp6ORYrCpu8%2BrmKxlk56%2FpLjEZmhpZaOdsm6%2BxJ%2BsrJ2jYsGwecueq2ahnmQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
