I consider it the Bentley of tattoos.”</p><p>Not that Cabrera, 30, has a man-crush on the Gangster Squad actor. On the contrary, he explains, he got the unusual ink in unexpected fashions with his pals.</p><p>“We like to play a game called tattoo roulette,” he began, explaining how he came to have Gosling’s face permanently etched onto his right calf several months ago. “We blindfold each other: ‘You get to pick a tattoo for me, and I get to pick a tattoo for you.’ And you don’t get to see it till they’re both done.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Ryan-Cabrera-Gets-Ryan-Goslings-Face-Tattooed-on-His-Leg-Picture2-.jpg><p>Cabrera added that though he didn’t know what tattoo his friend had chosen for him, he did have to insist on keeping the ink off his arms, which he reserves for “real tattoos.”</p><p>Any ink that he earns as a result of losing tattoo roulette are instead relegated to his legs, “because I just think that is funny.”</p><p>The pop rocker — whose exes include <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Ashlee Simpson</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Audrina Patridge</strong></a> — has numerous other tattoos on his body, including an entire sleeve on his left arm, and an interpretation of the Beatles’ famous Abbey Road album cover proudly displayed on his right forearm.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>But despite calling it the “Bentley of tattoos,” Cabrera isn’t in any rush to show his Gosling tattoo to the 32-year-old actor anytime soon.</p><p>“No, no, no, I’m not showing it to Ryan,” the singer said with a laugh.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarsZGjeqStwaucq5ldnLK1v4yrsJqmXZy8tLjIp56sZZaWsKZ505qrraefmrFuu81mn6KrXaGyqHnPopqtraKaenN8kGxpbWc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
