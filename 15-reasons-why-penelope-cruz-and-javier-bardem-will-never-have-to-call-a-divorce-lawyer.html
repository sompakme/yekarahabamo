They had a secret wedding in 2010 in the Bahama’s and it’s hard to believe that time has passed so quickly. We don’t hear a lot about this couple because they just aren’t the type. Just like their wedding, they like to keep their relationship under wraps as well. We don’t like it, but it’s something that we have come to expect from the actors.</p><p>One aspect of the relationship is that they have pretty epic chemistry onscreen as well as offscreen. The two are deeply in love and how could we not be happy for them. These two are considered to be Spanish royalty. Even though they typically keep their relationship a secret, there have been moments where they allowed us a peek inside their love affair. For those of you who don’t know, these two go as far back as the 1992 film Jamon, Jamon. It was a foxy, dark comedy that was a little controversial. It included a love triangle and director José Juan Bigas Luna was determined to make use of the intense chemistry between the two actors. The two heated up the screens in this movie and it was pretty obvious from the get-go that there was something intense and passionate between them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We have seen many couples over the years that we would consider to be #relationshipgoals, but there is just something between these two that is just magical. Check out these 15 reasons why Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem will never have to call a divorce lawyer.</p><h2 id=the-adorable-forehead-kiss><strong>The Adorable&nbsp;Forehead Kiss</strong></h2><p>There is just something about an image like this that just sums it up for us. The forehead kiss is the one thing that a man can do that will not only make us feel so special but makes us feel safe as well. Although they met in 1992, they didn’t get together right away. It wasn’t until close to 2007 that we started to see some offscreen action as well.</p><p><strong>Even when suspicions were being raised about the two being together, they still denied it.</strong></p><p>They were spotted however on the Maldive Islands in October of 2007 in a tender moment that was anything but “friendly.” It was obvious right from the beginning that there was more going on than just a friendship. They couldn’t really deny things after this photo came out.</p><h2 id=the-two-adore-each-other><strong>The Two Adore Each Other</strong></h2><p>That’s certainly part of the couple’s magic and it’s one way that a relationship can stay long term. How can you not love these two when you see a picture like this one? It just makes our hearts melt. When Javier has talked about their relationship, he has always stated that he’s “happily married.” The pictures don’t lie. During an interview with GQ in 2012, Javier was pretty candid about his relationship with Cruz.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“I breathe and stay in peace. I truly thank whoever’s up there for giving me the opportunity to be loved.”</strong></p><p>If that isn’t the sweetest thing ever, then we don’t know what is. There’s no doubt about it, it would be hard to tear these two away from each other. We really can’t blame him, Cruz is a fox and that accent is why we love Spanish so much.</p><h2 id=they-love-saving-the-world-together><strong>They Love Saving the World Together</strong></h2><p>The environment is an issue that is near and dear to the couple and it’s one crusade that they choose to fight together. We all know the danger that the earth faces because of climate change and pollution. They have a soft spot for Antarctica and Javier Bardem was there to help the penguins. He worked alongside Greenpeace to make a documentary about the penguins to ask people to help them. Penelope posted this photo to Instagram with the caption,</p><p><strong>“This planet is a blue planet. The oceans are far bigger than every continent combined, but climate change, pollution and overfishing are killing them. Now, we have the chance to create a sanctuary over three times bigger than my home country of Spain #ProtectAntarctic.”</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When couples get involved in the same passion, it certainly helps to awaken a new bond.</p><h2 id=they-are-best-friends-first><strong>They Are Best Friends First</strong></h2><p>We’ve been told for years that the longest lasting relationships out there are the ones that first started out as friends. We already know that these two knew each other long before they started dating, so they were likely friends first. They probably didn’t start anything up because they were dating other people at the time. When it comes to Bardem who is a very handsome man, he sees himself as ridiculous looking and probably wonders how he managed to get someone like Penelope Cruz.</p><p><strong>“I can't even watch that nose, that voice, those ridiculous eyes. I can't handle that. Even when I'm doing it, I don’t see my nose or hear my voice; it’s like there’s something stronger, bigger than that. And I need to express it.”</strong></p><p>We know that Cruz can’t get enough of that face.</p><h2 id=they-keep-their-relationship-private><strong>They Keep Their Relationship Private</strong></h2><p>As much as we love to hear all about celebrity relationships, we still have to admit that many of the celebrities who splash their relationship all over the place have not lasted very long. In reality, we don’t need to know every aspect of a couple’s relationship to appreciate their love. Cruz and Bardem get that and they aren’t willing to risk their relationship for anything and that’s why they have chosen to keep it private. The two have been married for eight years now which is certainly a stretch when it comes to Hollywood standards. The two started dating after they starred in another film together called Vicky Cristina Barcelona. That’s when the two decided that they didn’t want to be apart any longer. They now have two children together to complete their little family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=javier-really-thought-about-his-decision-to-date-her><strong>Javier Really Thought About His Decision To Date Her</strong></h2><p>We are betting that he’s really glad that he did. He admitted during an interview with GQ that he wasn’t sure about asking Penelope out at first. He’s not into dating high-profile actors and worried that she was going to be a handful. He didn’t want to date anyone that was so famous that it would make it hard for the two of them to be together in the future. That says a lot about the kind of woman that he was looking for.</p><p><strong>He didn’t just jump at the chance to be with a beautiful woman, he considered whether she was truly right for him.</strong></p><p>That careful thought might be part of why they have been together for so long. He was making this decision while the two were making movies together. It looks like he made the right decision after all.</p><h2 id=the-two-actors-are-opposites><strong>The Two Actors Are Opposites</strong></h2><p>You know what they say, opposites attract and in this case, it’s actually true. We can’t help but love these two. Javier said that one of the things he loves most about Penelope is her fiery personality. He is not like that at all, so he loves the fact that she is. Although he loved that passionate side of Penelope, he was also a little scared of it as well. Men, always need a good dose of fear in their lives. He even said to himself,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"Oh, boy. She has that feistiness."</strong></p><p>It wasn’t an easy decision for him to make especially since he wasn’t a fiery person himself. He had to ask himself if this was really the kind of relationship that he wanted. In the end, he jumped in with both feet first.</p><h2 id=they-take-care-of-each-other><strong>They Take Care of Each Other</strong></h2><p>You can tell in this photo that he’s very attentive towards her. When it comes to Javier he’s a real gentleman; he’s the kind of guy that will hold doors open for his lady or help her if she has a wardrobe malfunction. Penelope looks like a goddess in this photo and it’s no wonder he looks like he’s at her beck and call. She&nbsp;gives just as much back though. That’s her strong man and she cares for him in all the ways that he needs. There was a time when Penelope wasn’t sure about marriage, but it seems that the right man won her over.</p><p><strong>“I don't know if I believe in marriage. I believe in family, love and children.”</strong></p><p>The two of them definitely have the love part down pat.</p><h2 id=he-s-in-love-with-her-personality><strong>He’s In Love With Her Personality</strong></h2><p>It’s easy to say that he fell in love with her because she’s a total fox, but we all know there’s always much more to it than that. Sure, at first, he may have been a little scared of her fiery personality but in the end that was the thing that he loved about her the most. The passion that she had for life was something that he had never seen before.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“She has what I call the loving blood. Passion for everything."</strong></p><p>The more that he got to know her, the more he realized that it was her personality that he fell in love with. It’s hard to pass something like passion up. If someone is passionate, they are passionate about everything including the people they love and that’s addicting.</p><h2 id=these-two-know-how-to-have-fun-together><strong>These Two Know How To Have Fun Together</strong></h2><p>Life is hard and marriage can be just as hard. But if two people can have fun together and especially laugh together, then they can be a hell of a team. When there are ups and downs in a relationship the sure way to get through them is not to take them seriously and learn how to laugh at yourself. It’s obvious these two can have fun together but they’re not going to tell us all their secrets.</p><p><strong>“I am amazed about how everyone wants to know about my love life. They whisper to me, 'Tell me the truth? Is it true?' Who cares?</strong></p><p>Because we have this job, we are to say to everybody what we do, or with whom we sleep? It's a bit absurd, but that's why everybody lies so much.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-know-how-to-balance-work-and-play><strong>They Know How To Balance Work And Play</strong></h2><p>The two of them have been in a few movies together and they think it’s a great idea. It allows them to be together while they work. But they also know when to separate it so when it was time to go home at the end of the day, they wouldn’t discuss work or their projects. They never mesh their business life with their personal life and it’s certainly been working for them so far. They most recently worked on the movie Loving Pablo together and they were able to share their passion together. Movies are where they met after all so if it works for them then why not work together more. Javier believes that the fact that they work together has made them a much stronger couple.</p><h2 id=they-love-creating-new-things-together><strong>They Love Creating New Things Together</strong></h2><p>Why would you want to leave your spouse if you didn’t want to? Many celebrity marriages and relationships have ended because couples spent too much time apart. Working in Hollywood can be hard on a marriage. So far Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz have worked on three movies together and they are looking forward to doing more. Bardem loves the fact that the two of them can create new things together, like a movie. They are both such great actors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“One of the joys, and the fun of what we do, is to create. We were very careful [during shooting] to make sure we kept that joy and that we keep being able to create and use our imagination.”</strong></p><p>It sounds like these two have a great formula they are working on together. We look forward to seeing more movies with them together.</p><h2 id=they-understand-each-other><strong>They Understand Each Other</strong></h2><p>When it comes to working together, they both recognize that their onscreen relationship is very different from their offscreen one. They need to know how to separate the two so that when they get home, they aren’t overwhelmed by it all. Javier stated,</p><p><strong>“In this movie, I think both of us learned more than ever to do that because it was necessary for us to be able to get back to ourselves. To go back home and have a life. And actually, it was easy. It was fun and I think we both made a little step towards growing up as performers because instead of stepping around things we really went there.”</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some Hollywood couples have been unable to work together while others are Hollywood gold. In this case, Javier and Penelope have a good thing going on.</p><h2 id=penelope-and-javier-want-their-children-out-of-the-limelight><strong>Penelope And Javier Want Their Children Out Of The Limelight</strong></h2><p>It’s pretty obvious that these two are very private people. If you go on Penelope’s Instagram, you will see almost no couple pictures or family pictures and only a few of Javier himself. She doesn’t believe in putting her life out there for any reason. The two believe that their children should grow up with as much anonymity as possible.</p><p><strong>“I want my son —&nbsp;and my kids, if I have more —&nbsp;to grow up in a way that is as anonymous as possible. The fact that his father and I have chosen to do the work that we do doesn't give anybody the right to invade our privacy.”</strong></p><p>They aren’t the first celebrities that have said something like this and it’s probably the healthiest thing for the children in the end.</p><h2 id=they-live-life-to-the-fullest><strong>They Live Life&nbsp;To The Fullest&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>These two love the idea of growing old together and aging has never been a worry for Penelope, she has said that she would never lie about her age. These two like to live very natural and very normal lives away from the spotlight and it may be why their marriage is so strong. Many of us, including other celebrities, could learn a lot from these two. Penelope is big on natural aspects of motherhood. You might be surprised to hear that Penelope nursed her children for over a year. “I breastfed my son for 13 months, and I plan to do at least the same with my daughter.&nbsp;That's an amazing thing for babies, but it's also really good for the mother because it regulates your body again after pregnancy.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">www.latina.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">www.meaww.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nYWp6s7HArKanq12stbp5z56lnqSfpbJur9GusWaZnpl6q63VopyrZZKWv6WxzGauoqScYrumwsSrZKGZppp6tbuMnJilpF2WeqW11aipnJ1doa64xcSrZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
