She was a salesperson, a waitress, a research lab attendant, and a bartender. Azzy wanted to be a doctor when she was younger. That is the reason why she studied subjects related to science and biology in college. Later, the actress decided to make a YouTube career because she realized she was homophobic.</p><p>Azzy started her YouTube channel in the year 2015. Back then, she would make videos related to cosplay. People began noticing Azzy when she created those videos.
