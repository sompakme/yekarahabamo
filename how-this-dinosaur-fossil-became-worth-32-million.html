Rex and the Velociraptor go for $3 million to $10 million.</p><p>DiCaprio is a known art trader as well, with drawings by Picasso, Dali and Jean-Michel Basquiat according to <a href=#>Art Net </a>which put them in the same ballpark as a 60-million-year-old artifact.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Australian actor Crowe recently held a large auction following his divorce from Danielle Spencer. Among the auctioned items, was the fossil of a giant marine reptile, a Mosasaur for approximately $40,000 and leading many to believe Crowe has a small collection of fossils at home.</p><p>As the trend grew, auction houses and galleries like Aguttes, Christie’s and Sotheby’s have regularly sold a variety of dinosaur fossils to ultra-rich collectors, but scientists say the practice can be detrimental to the science community.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Most Obscure (And Most Valuable) Items Ever Sold At An Auction</a></span></p><h2 id=scientists-speak-out>Scientists Speak Out</h2><p>Art collectors and enthusiasts claim skeletons are truly a work of art, requiring paleontologists, artisans, designers and historian experts to restore the large pieces, according to <a href=#>W Magazine</a>.

The two have spent decades searching and digging for dinosaur fossils, excavating 11 T. Rexes and many other fossils now housed in museums and collections around the world.</p><p>They are the pair behind Chicago’s famous Field Museum T. Rex, Sue. She was the most expensive dinosaur to date at $8,400,000 until Stan was sold in 2020.</p><p>After a lifetime of working together and discovering new scientific evidence, the two had a falling out and wanted to separate their assets at the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research in Hill City, S.D., including their coveted Stan.</p><p>According to the <a href=#>Wall Street Journal</a>, two years ago a circuit-court judge ordered the brothers to divide their assets and part ways.</p><p>Pete received the institute, 100,000 fossils and private museum valued at $5 million and Neal was given the right to sell Stan, estimating its value around $5 million to $6 million. However, as the live auction began on Oct. 6 both brothers watched virtually as bidders began to rise higher and higher for the famous piece.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the end, a $32 million price tag took Stan off the market and Neal is a lot richer than originally anticipated.</p><p>“That’s more than we’ve grossed in the entire history of our business,” Peter commented.</p><p>The brothers have had their share of misfortune and disappointment over their work. In the mid-1990’s they lost a legal battle over Sue, handing her over to a local for ultimate auction. The family began falling apart after that, and Stan is perhaps the final blow.</p><p>“The trauma from that older case still grates on this family, and I think it exacerbated any existing cracks,” said Kristin Donnan, Peter’s former wife. “Stan did what Sue couldn’t do: It broke up the family.”</p><p>Lawsuits, one brother firing another and the need to part ways grew over the years, culminating with the court’s decision two years ago,” said the Wall Street Journal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the brothers amazing discoveries and personal story of loss and disconnect, the questions remain how to protect science and allow all to enjoy.</p><p>While fossil collecting doesn’t seem to be losing steam, hopefully the world as a whole doesn’t suffer in scientific discovery and education.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio's Huge Art Auction (And 14 Other Celebs With Personal Art Collections)</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Art Net</a>, <a href=#>W Magazine</a>, <a href=#>Mercury News</a>, <a href=#>Wall Street Journal</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8Oipairkaq%2FbrLOrKqipF2svLPAx2Zqa2Wdnrmttc6nZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
