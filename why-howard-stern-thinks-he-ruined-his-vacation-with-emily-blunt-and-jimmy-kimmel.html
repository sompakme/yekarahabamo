At least, this is what he constantly claims to his fans. Anyone who listens to The Howard Stern Show on Sirius XM knows that Howard is utterly particular about his social life.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Is Howard Stern a diva? </a>Well, not in the conventional sense, but his antics have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ruined his producer's dinner party </a>and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">beloved holidays such as Halloween</a>. Apparently, he's also a vacation ruiner... Here's what happened...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=traveling-with-mega-celebrities-didn-t-go-as-planned>Traveling With Mega-Celebrities Didn't Go As Planned</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In May 2021</a>&nbsp;Howard spoke about how his peculiarities and eccentricities ruined a vacation he took with two of his celebrity friends, Emily Blunt and Jimmy Kimmel.</p><p>For those who don't know, Howard and his with Beth are extremely friendly with Jimmy Kimmel and his wife Molly. Through Jimmy, Howard has become close with the likes of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston</a>, George Clooney, Emily Blunt, and John Krasinski. The latter two even joined Howard, Beth, Molly, and Jimmy on a vacation in Mexico a few years ago.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Howard and Beth could be seen&nbsp;hanging out with Jennifer Aniston, her former husband Justin Theroux, as well as Courteney Cox down in the sun, he actually stayed with the stars of The Quiet Place. And it was on this vacation where Emily Blunt learned that she couldn't successfully travel with the legendary shock jock.</p><p>During her recent interview on The Howard Stern Show, Emily Blunt spoke about her love for Howard and his wife Beth. But she also claimed that her energy didn't quite match Howard's while on vacation.</p><p>"I think you're a delight. I think you're genuinely curious," Emily said to Howard on air. "I love talking to you off radio and I love talking to you on radio. And I think you're a doll. I really love you."</p><p>"While we were on vacation, I didn't think you liked me in our moments alone," Howard responded.</p><p>"I feel like you kept to yourself. You and Beth did your own thing. You guys were asleep by 8 PM," Emily laughed. "We were all just being like idiots and you were being like a dad and going to bed at 8. You're SO well behaved."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In short, everyone just wanted Howard to join the party. While Jimmy Kimmel, who has traveled with Howard numerous times, is used to his dad-like rhythms, he too wanted Howard to join the fun. Still, it sounds as though Howard and Jimmy can find lots of daytime activities to do together, such as blackberry picking and painting, according to Howard's interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live!</p><p>But even Jimmy wanted Howard just to let loose for once and party with his new mega-celebrity friends... But Howard just couldn't change his healthy routines.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth About Howard Stern's Relationship With John Stamos</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We would be staggering to bed while you were just fresh as a daisy. You'd be having your green juice and be going for a walk with Beth," Emily laughed. "I didn't know how to identify with you on vacation. I like talking to you in a restaurant but I can't vacation with you. We're too different."</p><h2 id=howard-worries-he-ruined-their-vacation>Howard Worries He Ruined Their Vacation</h2><p>The following day, Howard when on air&nbsp;to further address the topic...</p><p>"I am not fun on a vacation," Howard said to his co-host Robin Quivers&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on the May 12, 2021, episode</a> of his Sirius XM show. "People learn that."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Howard Stern Really Thinks Of Laura Dern And Frances McDormand</a></span></p><p>"They stayed up every night. All of them. Jimmy, Molly, Emily Blunt, and her husband," Howard said. "[Emily and John were like]&nbsp;'Hey, let's go wake Howard up, it'll be funny because he goes to bed at 8 o'clock.' And Beth said, 'Oh, no, no no. That would be really bad. I know my customer'. I am not fun. I have not been invited back."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Howard was worried that he was missing out on the fun, he just couldn't help himself but go to bed early and get up early. This is his routine when he's working and he just can't seem to shake it. He also explained that he's a health nut so he's constantly worried about consuming things that would cause him to gain weight or get sick. That means little to no 'fun' food or alcohol.... Yeah, he's not exactly the life of the party.</p><p>Even though Beth can get in on the fun with everyone, she too found herself moving by Howard's rhythm. What she's not on board with, according to Howard, is his constant complaining. It's either too hot or too cold. Then there's the complaining about the bugs and the paparazzi. As Howard has said himself, he has a really hard time just relaxing and enjoying things while away from home. Luckily for him and Beth, Jimmy, Molly, John, and Emily all still want to hang out with him... Just not while on vacation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Howard Stern Really Thought About The Royal Interview With Oprah</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdnby4rdGdZKyslae7bsDHoqWkq12dsm6%2B1KKlnpxdnba0edWampqsmaS7bsPIrZ9mnZ2eubp5waWsp6xdlrulecmipKaxXaC2rrnEpWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
