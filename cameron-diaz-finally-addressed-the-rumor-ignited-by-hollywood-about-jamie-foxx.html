You just want to scream at the top of your lungs, like, 'What are you talking about?,'" Diaz said.</p><p>"Jamie is, like, the cheerleader for the entire crew. Everybody loves him. We have so much fun on the set with him, and he's just a professional on every level," Diaz added.</p><ul><li>For the unfamiliar, it was alleged that Diaz and Foxx were at odds while filming the picture.</li><li>"Jamie is being a total pill and sadly Cameron’s bearing the brunt of his foul moods," an alleged source said, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">per Radar Online</a>.</li><li>"You’d think he’d be thrilled he convinced her to be in his movie, but he hates that she is the center of attention," another revealed.</li><li>"Cameron doesn’t enjoy this type of negativity and stress in her life. The whole reason she quit movies for so long was to get away from BS and drama. Instead, here she is at the center of Jamie’s sniping and 6,000 miles from home, working her butt off through gritted teeth," a source said.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That sounds like a nightmare set, but Diaz was more than happy to clear the air and shut this all down.</p><p>Speaking on her personal feelings towards Foxx, Diaz was blunt.</p><p>"Jamie is the best. I love that guy so much. He's such a special person and he's so talented, so much fun."</p><p>Despite things going well overall, Diaz did note that things weren't entirely smooth.</p><p>"The hiccups that happened throughout production are the natural kinds of things that happen, but nothing got delayed other than, obviously, toward the end. And that's something that is not my place to speak about," she said.</p><p>It's great to hear that those reports were wildly off base, as this film was a return to acting for Diaz.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/cameron-diaz-and-benji-madden.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Cameron Diaz Announces Birth Of Second Baby In Secret At Age 51">Cameron Diaz Announces Birth Of Second Baby In Secret At Age 51</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Fans react with surprise and support to Cameron Diaz and Benji Madden's announcement of the birth of their second child.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-film-saw-cameron-diaz-coming-out-of-retirement-from-acting>The Film Saw Cameron Diaz Coming Out Of Retirement From Acting</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cameron-diaz-wearing-a-red-dress.jpg><p>After being out of the limelight for some time, Diaz spoke with Gwyneth Paltrow and opened up about retiring from acting.</p><p>"I got a peace in my soul, because I finally was taking care of myself. It's a strange thing to say, I know a lot of people won't understand it, I know you understand it, but it's so intense to work at that level and be that public and put yourself out there. There's a lot of energy coming at you at all times when you're really visible as an actor and doing press and putting yourself out there," she revealed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I stopped and really looked at my life," she said. "When you're making a movie, they own you. You're there for 12 hours a day for months on end, you have no time for anything else. I really needed to know that I could take care of myself, that I knew how to be an adult," she added.</p><p>Prior to this retirement, Diaz had a wildly successful career, and was taking home massive paydays.</p><p>In 2011, her film, Bad Teacher, scored her a career-best payday, after agreeing to earn profits on the film.</p><p>"The movie went on to earn more than $210 million worldwide, and when it was all said and done, Cameron walked away with $42 million. That's enough to be one of the 20 highest single-film paychecks ever earned by an actor," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a> reports.</p><p>Those checks are what largely ensured that she never had to work again.</p><p>2014's Annie was her final film before coming back for Back in Action.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cameron-diaz-and-benji-madden-paparazzi-photo.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Cameron Diaz And Benji Madden Allegedly Isolate Themselves From Loved Ones To Protect Their Kids’ Privacy">Cameron Diaz And Benji Madden Allegedly Isolate Themselves From Loved Ones To Protect Their Kids’ Privacy</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Cameron and Benji are apparently making big sacrifices to keep the identity of their kids private.</p><p>With the air clear on the situation, fans are excited to see Foxx and Diaz in Back in Action, which is set for a November 2024 release on Netflix.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiamqWVp7yvecOimLNlmpa6qrGMn6axsF2nwq670Wg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
