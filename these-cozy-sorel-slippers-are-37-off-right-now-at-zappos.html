Whether you prefer fuzzy or less frilly options, finding the perfect pair of <a href=# rel=noopener>slippers</a> to meet your needs is an easy shopping expedition.

You can throw these on with your favorite pair of joggers and a sweatshirt while lounging around the house. Note — it’s best to keep these babies indoors to keep their material intact.</p><p>Sorel has thousands of fans worldwide, but one Zappos reviewer said, “Comfy. They are easy to put on without hands, aka slide feet in and go. They don’t slip on the floor. The sole is solid enough to feel good about wearing them outside but also soft enough to not be uncomfortable if you curl up on the couch with them on. They are warm, and oddly, my feet don’t sweat in them like they do in my other leather and wool slippers. I bought these to replace an older pair of Sorel slippers that is no longer available. I was grumpy because the soles had worn out on them too soon. And my husband laughed at me and said 15 years probably was not “too soon.” I guess tie flies. A solid slipper. Thanks, Sorel. I’d buy again without hesitation.”</p><p>Another satisfied Zappos reviewer added, “I tried these on in a store, but they didn’t have the color I wanted. So, I purchased them online. I usually wear a 9 1/2, but I bought a nine since it fit in the store. They were a little snug when I first received them, but as the lining settled down a few days later, they fit. They are really comfortable and warm, and I like that the sole doesn’t clop on the floor, but it is more muffled. I would definitely recommend them over the three-letter, very expensive slippers, which I thought were not nearly as comfortable.”</p><p>If you want a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">warm and fuzzy pair of slippers</a> for January, then these beauties from Sorel are well-worth your consideration!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sorel Nakiska Slide II Slippers</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$54</a> (previously $85) at Zappos!</strong></p><p><strong>Not quite what you’re looking for?
