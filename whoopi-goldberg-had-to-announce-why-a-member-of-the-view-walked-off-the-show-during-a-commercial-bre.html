The former View host admitted her time on the show wasn't easy, and filled with tough moments behind the scenes. We'll take a closer look at her time on the show, and what would lead to her walking off during a break following an exchange with Whoopi Goldberg.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Tom Cruise Was On The Verge Of Tears When Barbara Walters Brought Up An Unexpected Question On The View</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=candace-cameron-bure-and-whoopi-goldberg-got-into-a-heated-debate-but-candace-was-gone-when-the-show-returned-for-its-break>Candace Cameron Bure And Whoopi Goldberg Got Into A Heated Debate, But Candace Was Gone When The Show Returned For Its Break</h2><p>At the time of the discussion back in 2016, Jada Pinkett Smith boycotting the Oscars due to lack of diversity made the headlines. Whoopi Golberg in particular was very heated about the subject, not agreeing with Smith's decision. She said on The View, “Boycotting doesn't work, and it's also a slap in the face to Chris Rock,” said the four-time Oscars host.</p><p>Cameron tried to get a word in during the discussion, but it was almost impossible given that Goldberg was so heated about the topic. Cameron can be seen sarcastically conversing with Joy Behar after she gets ignored. This prompts Goldberg to say, “Well you know what, I talk about God, you gotta talk about these damn movies,” Goldberg told Cameron-Bure. “I get it,” she responded.</p><p>After the show comes back from a commercial break, fans notice Candace Cameron Bure is no longer there. Some felt as though it was because of the moment alongside Goldberg. However, that was not the case. Bure left due to an illness.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Golberg said when the show returned from break, "We got Candace some orange juice. I’d asked her if she needed something to drink because … she went pale white. So we got her something to drink, and her color’s coming back.”</p><p>“She didn’t want you to think she just walked off and wasn’t having it, she just really wasn’t feeling well."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>8 Times Arguments That Got So Heated On The View The Hosts Almost Walked Off</a></span></p><p>Following the episode, Bure would also take to Twitter, letting fans know what had taken place. "I left the show today b/c I didn't feel well, not because of the discussion. Saw the doctor- low blood sugar & tested positive for flub."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the very least, Bure gave fans clarity as to what had taken place. However, it wasn't the only time a commercial break was needed on the show and, in truth, Bure herself admitted adapting to the show took some time.</p><h2 id=candace-cameron-bure-admitted-she-cried-a-lot-on-the-view-backstage>Candace Cameron Bure Admitted She Cried A Lot On The View Backstage</h2><p>People discussed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Candace Cameron-Bure walking off The View</a>, and they also touched on how the star felt about debating with her co-hosts on the program. As expected, Bure revealed it was quite the task at times, though she was advised not to take anything personally.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/candace-cameron-bure-smiling.jpg><p>Bure tells People, “Things can get really heated on the show, and we can disagree about things on a fundamental level.” “I get asked a lot, ‘How can you sit next to someone who you disagree with so much? How do you stand it?’ ” Cameron-Bure said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She continues, “But the veterans Joy Behar and Whoopi Goldberg do a great job of making sure we all know that nothing is to be taken personally. We can be having a loud discussion on air but the minute the cameras are off, we’re all friendly. … I think it’s really important for society to see that we can have healthy, meaningful debates and treat each other with respect and kindness.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Joy Behar Refused To Discuss One Particular ABC Show Behind The Scenes On The View</a></span></p><p>Bure would go on to reveal that the show was very stressful, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she cried every day hosting The View</a>, given the pressures that came with such a role.</p><h2 id=whoopi-goldberg-was-also-advised-by-a-show-39-s-producer-to-cut-to-a-commercial-after-her-argument-got-too-heated>Whoopi Goldberg Was Also Advised By A Show's Producer To Cut To A Commercial After Her Argument Got Too Heated</h2><p>The View isn't short on drama, and that held true after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a producer yelled at Goldberg to cut to commercial as she argued with the co-hosts</a>. The topic of conversation was around whether it was okay to yell at your children. Goldberg had a stern stance on the matter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ttweb_whoopi-goldberg-had-to-announce-why-a-member-of-the-view-walked-off-the-show-during-a-commercial-break_bk_a1.jpg><p>"I’m sorry, you have to yell at your kids from time to time. Sometimes they just don’t get it. So you have to get a little bit louder. That’s not to say you say, ‘You dumb ugly punk.’ That’s not what we’re doing. We’re saying, 'If you take one more step in this house…'”</p><p>Co-hosts Sunny Hostin and Joy Behar disagreed with Goldberg's opinion, and it caused a debate between the two sides. Ultimately, executive producer Brian Teta steps in and tells Whoopi to take a commercial break. "Do it now! Go to commercial!" he was caught saying.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Golberg didn't hear the producer, and would take the commercial on his second request...</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaefpbZus86lm5udopx6qa3DZquoZZGju7DBzZycZq%2BYrnqkrc2dmJydXZiurrHRqKVmmqWnsm7DwKWinpxdpLOnedOhnGarmKTEbrDUq6Cnn12WeqS7zKacq5uZlrlurtGemKRn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
