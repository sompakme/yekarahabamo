Yet for a person who infamously fought against being “blackballed,” her video proves that Mo’Nique is prepared to take on this issue as well.</p><p>But unlike her battles of the past, Mo’Nique is not alone in this war. Her video was closely preceded by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Black-ish </a>star, Tracee Ellis Ross, announcing she makes “significantly less” than co-star Anthony Anderson, a claim that if it’s not corrected, the wage gap may result in the Golden Globe winner devoting less time to the show.&nbsp;Stories like the one shared by Mo’Nique and Ross, appear to speak to the struggle women face in the workforce.</p><p>And as Hollywood continues to fight against the onslaught of sexual assault accusations, this may be the perfect time for the male-driven entertainment industry to extend the same protection and pay to women counterparts.</p><p>“And then (Netflix) said: ‘Oh, by the way, we believe Mo’Nique is a legend too,’” Mo’Nique explained toward the end of&nbsp;the video. “Well, then why aren’t I getting what the legends are getting paid?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6K8r7XQrpxmppWts62112aZqLGTpMG1ecaepZ2domKwsLjOq2SboZGoeqK52GaqnKClorKzeZRvZ2pvYGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
