The Canada native and the Mötley Crüe drummer, who were married from 1995 to 1998, didn’t participate in the show’s production, though star <a href=#><strong>Lily James</strong></a> — who portrayed the former Playboy model in the miniseries — reached out to Anderson ahead of filming.</p><p>“I was really hopeful that she would be involved. I wish it had been different,” the <a href=#>Downton Abbey</a> alum told Net-a-Porter’s Porter in January 2022. “My sole intention was to take care of the story and to play Pamela authentically.”</p><p>An insider exclusively told Us Weekly at the time that Anderson “won’t be watching” the series, which also featured <a href=#><strong>Sebastian Stan</strong></a> as Lee and <a href=#><strong>Seth Rogen</strong></a> as <strong>Rand Gauthier</strong> (the man who stole the tape). “She had no involvement whatsoever,” the source added.</p><p>Anderson has claimed that no one from Pam & Tommy ever reached out to her about the show, but showrunner <strong>D.V. DeVincentis</strong> alleged they tried to get in contact with the Scary Movie 3 star. “We particularly wanted to let Pamela Anderson know that this portrayal was very much a positive thing and that we cared a great deal about her and wanted her to know that the show loves her,” the <a href=#>American Crime Story</a> producer told Entertainment Weekly in January 2022. “We didn’t get a response, but considering what she’s been through and the time that we were reaching out, that was understandable.”</p><p>Shortly after Pam & Tommy‘s premiere, Anderson announced she was <a href=#>working on a Netflix documentary about her life</a>. “My life: A thousand imperfections, a million misperceptions,” <a href=#>the Barb Wire actress said in a handwritten note</a> accompanying Netflix’s announcement. “Wicked, wild and lost. Nothing to live up to — I can only surprise you. Not a victim, but a survivor. And alive to tell the real story.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While Anderson didn’t watch Pam & Tommy, <a href=#>an insider told Us that the series</a> was a major reason that the former model decided to make Pamela, A Love Story. “She hated how sensationalized the story was and wanted to be able to tell hers from the beginning,” the source explained. “[She] didn’t want to consult with someone writing her life for her. She wanted to start fresh.”</p><p>Keep scrolling for everything Anderson has said about Pam & Tommy:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksrex0bKroaGenHqxrcyeo5plkaOxpr7SqKVmoJGoerStyJ1kmpqfqsFuvMCmZK2nnaLGcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
