You know, I was like, ‘I know exactly what I want. I know exactly what kind of woman I want to be,’ and I always said I’d never be a mom. There’s so many reasons now that are coming to fruition as to why I would have said that then, but I do know that you never say never, and that love can really change you and I’m so thankful to be on a show that’s really helped me to grow and to evolve and to see myself differently that I would have ever imagined seeing myself.</p><p>The TV presenter, who <a href=#>married the 43-year-old rapper in March</a>, opened up about the pregnancy further with <a href=#>Women’s Health</a>.</p><p>“Jeezy and I have been kind of saving this and hiding this for five months,” she said in a feature published on Monday. “So, we’re relieved to finally share the news.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jeannie-Mai-Jenkins-Pregnant-Expecting-First-Child-With-Jeezy.jpg><p>The <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a> alum noted that “it was not easy” for her to get pregnant, but that the couple knew they wanted to start a family last year and began in-vitro fertilization.</p><p>“We both needed a bit of assistance, especially with me being 41 at the time,” she said, revealing she found out she was pregnant one month before their wedding but suffered a miscarriage soon after.</p><p>“I wondered if I was being punished. I wondered if I’d jinxed myself or cursed myself,” she said, noting that she didn’t ever want to have children until the prior year. “My entire life, I never wanted children. When I say never, I’m talking a hard-stop never. … <a href=#>Falling in love with Jeezy</a> made me see life differently for myself. Our love is honest, pure and safe — something I hadn’t felt as a child.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>One week after their wedding, the couple found out they were pregnant again.</p><p>“It was the most beautiful sign that anything’s possible, that you’re not in control and God has a plan,” she said. “Being a mom is hands down the hardest role in the entire world. Now that we’re bringing another Jenkins into the picture, I have no idea what to expect.”</p><p>She added that her husband is <a href=#>already “an amazing dad</a>” to his three children from previous relationships, gushing, “It overwhelms me with even more love.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGajnZGju6qxjKaYomWamrustc2sZKmqlZy7orrTZpyxqJWYwaq6xmZorKxdmLWquMNmmJ%2Bslad6rrXSnJirqpmWtKZ7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
