That as long as I appeared to be in good shape, I would be fine, which got me into problems.”</strong></p><p>When she started her role as Monica Geller, that was the first time she went for fillers.</p><p>According to People, Courtney Cox’s plastic surgery took place because she wasn’t happy with herself and the way she looked.” <strong>“I attempted to keep up with time in a way that was anything other than maintenance,” </strong>she stated.</p><p><strong>“Well, what would end up happening is that you go to a doctor who would say, ‘You look great, but what would help is a little injection here or filler there.’</strong> <strong>”&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Courteney also spoke with New Beauty about how she got started, saying, <strong>“Well, what would end up happening is that you go to a doctor who would say, ‘You look great, but what would help is a little injection here or filler there.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>“Then you hear about another doctor: You should just do this,’ they say when you meet them. “The next thing you know, you’re layered upon multiple times.</strong></p><p>Courteney said that she came to a halt when her mates informed her that she didn’t look like herself.&nbsp;</p><p>She previously told New Beauty in 2017 that you don’t see the results of plastic surgery until someone points it out to you.<strong> “You have no idea because it happens gradually until you realize, ‘Oh s**t, this isn’t right.</strong>‘</p><p>And it looks even worse on photos than it does in person.&nbsp;</p><p>She admitted to new beauty that when she didnt go for any fillers for six months one of her friends assumed that it was over for her with the plastic surgeries and got excited about it.&nbsp;</p><p>Her friends weren’t the only ones who made her stop, but seeing herself in images did as well. “<strong>I’d look at images and wonder, ‘Oh, is that how I appear?’&nbsp;</strong></p><p>And when I asked a friend, they would answer, ‘Oh God, no.’ And I’ve never considered myself delusional.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“I think images make things worse, so when others around the world see you and write terrible remarks, I say to myself, ‘It might be worse than it really is,'”</strong> she added. <strong>“I was trying so hard to keep up, and that actually made things worse,” </strong>Courteney continued<strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>She also said that now she tries to remain natural to her face as much as she can be.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCvzq6prZ2emsZur86xZKmkkajBqq%2BMrKyrn5WnxnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
