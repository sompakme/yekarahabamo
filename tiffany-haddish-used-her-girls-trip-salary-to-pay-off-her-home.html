Starring alongside veteran actresses Jada Pinkett Smith, Queen Latifah, and Regina Hall, Haddish revealed she was paid $80,000 for her role in a new <a href=# rel=nofollow>Cosmopolitan</a> cover story. She also revealed that she cashed in her funds to pay off her home to keep from homelessness again.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“So immediately when I started making a little bit of money doing things like&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Tyler Perry’s&nbsp;If Loving You Is Wrong</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Carmichael Show, I started trying to figure out how to create generational wealth,” Haddish revealed. “The fastest way to do it and the first way you should go about doing it is buy some land. So before we even got into season 2 of&nbsp;The Carmichael Show, I bought a house. Everybody told me I should wait, but I didn’t care.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Haddish was able to pay off her home after finishing the first season of&nbsp;the animated show. She was willing to sacrifice her first big check for everlasting security.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1392266870-e1654538101193.jpg alt="Tiffany caddish Harvard university" height width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Related Story</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-font-family-primary a-font-primary-bold-l lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-border-a-0"></h3><p>Tiffany Haddish Reveals She’s Attending Harvard University<br></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">She added, “I just knew I was going to have to always make enough money to take care of me and the house, and that’s what I did. Between that show’s next season,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>the&nbsp;Keanu movie</a>, and making sure I can live comfortably off of $500 a month, I was able to pay off half the house. The&nbsp;Girls Trip&nbsp;check was the final check. People told me to spend it in other ways, but I used it to pay off the house because I was always afraid of being homeless again.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Expressing that she never wants to be broke again, she went on to say, “Now I have a surplus of money, but I’m still afraid of being poor again. Every movie I made, I would just buy another piece of land or a house.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Read her full cover story with <a href=# rel=nofollow>Cosmopolitan</a> here.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6m2p7LAp7BmoJGZsaq%2Fx2aeoqqcqHq1vsipZKyZnJa%2FunnPmrBmp5abeqm7zJ5kampjaYN5gphsaWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
