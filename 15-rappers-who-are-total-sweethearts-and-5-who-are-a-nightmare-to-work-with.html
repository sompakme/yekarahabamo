In fact, some rappers are the sweetest people you’ll ever meet...and even sweeter to work with. There are plenty of artists that are constantly raising money for&nbsp;charity, giving back to others, and&nbsp;being good to their fans. It’s no wonder they’re so popular.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>Of course, with the good, there’s also the bad. There’s always a handful of rappers that are making headlines...and not for the right reasons! Bad press and bad reputations make these artists a nightmare to work with, and many artists want to stay far, far away from them. For that, we can’t blame them!</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Here are fifteen rappers who are total sweethearts and five who are a nightmare to work with.</span></p><h2 id=chance-the-rapper---sweetheart><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>Chance The Rapper - Sweetheart</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Chance The Rapper has been in the headlines often...for being a good person! Not only is he a great artist, he is constantly giving back to the community. According to </span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span style=font-weight:400>Rolling Stone</span></i></a><span style=font-weight:400>, Chance The Rapper raised $2.2 million for Chicago Public Schools’ arts program. That’s just one of many sweet things he’s done over the years.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=common---sweetheart><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>Common - Sweetheart</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Another sweetheart in the rap world has to be Common. Of course, he’s had some great hits over the years, but many people know him for his charitable ways. He has his own charity, Common Ground Foundation, that “serves as inspiration for equality, opportunity and hope among youth in underserved communities,” according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">looktothestars.org</a>.</span></p><h2 id=diddy---sweetheart><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>Diddy - Sweetheart</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Besides being known for making really good music, Diddy has to be one of the most charitable men in the music industry — there’s no reason why people don't want to work with him. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Complex</a>, he’s always donating money to charities and even helped save The Boys and Girls Club of Harlem in 2011.</span></p><h2 id=jay-z---sweetheart><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Jay-Z - Sweetheart</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jay-Z is arguably one of the most influential rappers in the music industry. Rappers are lining up to work with him, and many would love to be him. Jay-Z is always working hard to give back, even though it might not be making headlines. Way back in 2003, he started his own <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">charity</a>, The Shawn Carter Foundation, to help at-risk youth, and that’s just one of many ways he helps.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dr-dre---sweetheart><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Dr. Dre - Sweetheart</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>One of the most famous and influential rappers of all time, Dr. Dre, and music producer, Jimmy Iovine, teamed up to donate $70 million to the University of Southern California. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">looktothestars.org</a>,&nbsp;the money was used to create the USC Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young Academy for Arts, Technology and the Business of Innovation. A talented and charitable man for sure.</span></p><h2 id=snoop-dogg---sweetheart><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Snoop Dogg - Sweetheart</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Arguably everyone’s favorite rapper, Snoop Dogg is an industry favorite and a complete sweetheart. He’s made a number of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">donations</a> to a slew of charities over the years, coaches a youth football league, and has held charity basketball games. One way or another, Snoop always finds a way to give back.</span></p><h2 id=akon---sweetheart><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Akon - Sweetheart</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Akon is likely one of the most charitable rappers on this list. His biggest project had to be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lighting up Africa,</a> where (using solar energy) Akon was able to bring electricity to places in Africa that had never had electricity before. He changed millions of lives with all of his hard work.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=drake---sweetheart><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Drake - Sweetheart</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Drake is yet another sweetheart on this list. Not only does he make great music, but he is notorious for giving back. He’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">donated millions </a>over the years, to a number of charities, benefiting schools and local charities near to his heart. Drake’s got it all — a successful career and a desire to give back.</span></p><h2 id=2-chainz---sweetheart><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>2 Chainz - Sweetheart</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>2 Chainz has made hits on his own and has also had some pretty sweet collaborations. He really is a sweetheart, too, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">donating</a> a portion of the proceeds from his CEO Millionaires clothing line to homeless veterans. He’s been known to donate proceeds to people in need, making him quite the charitable rapper!</span></p><h2 id=nicki-minaj---sweetheart><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Nicki Minaj - Sweetheart</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>It seems like Nicki Minaj is constantly making headlines. Not only has she broken records in the music world, but she’s always <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">giving back</a> to the fans that support her. She encouraged her fans to tweet her their good grades, and in return she paid off a number of their student loans. Talk about giving back to those that gave to you!</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=j-cole---sweetheart><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>J. Cole - Sweetheart</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>J. Cole is not only a talented rapper, but also a huge sweetheart. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BET</a>, the rapper founded The Dreamville Foundation, to help the youth of Fayetteville, North Carolina live up to their biggest and best potential. The foundation funds programs for at-risk youth in the town.</span></p><h2 id=will-i-am---sweetheart><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Will.i.am - Sweetheart</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>It seems like everyone wants to work with Will.i.am these days, and no wonder! Not only does he make great music, he’s also always giving back. He has his own <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">i.am.angel</a> foundation, where he gives out scholarships and helps youth in the neighborhood in which he grew up.</span></p><h2 id=logic---sweetheart><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Logic - Sweetheart</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Logic is perhaps one of the biggest sweethearts on this list. Everyone knows about his big hit, “1-800-273-8255”, and the very important meaning behind it. Logic is very outspoken about suicide prevention and awareness, hence the song with the suicide hotline in the title. Logic hasn’t been afraid to talk about these issues, making him one of the most thoughtful artists today.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=childish-gambino---sweetheart><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Childish Gambino - Sweetheart</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Childish Gambino, aka Donald Glover, is an accomplished rapper, as well as an actor. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">knownetworth.com</a>, Childish Gambino works with Community Connections, a charity that helps out foster homes by providing anything that the foster homes might need. He’s raised money and donated his own, helping the cause as much as he can.</span></p><h2 id=missy-elliot---sweetheart><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Missy Elliot - Sweetheart</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Another sweetheart on this list is none other than Missy Elliott. She used her love of music to partner up with a few other artists (as well as First Lady Michelle Obama), to create a song called “This Is For My Girls.” According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MTV</a>, all proceeds from the song went to the Peace Corps Let Girls Learn Fund, to help raise money for education for girls.</span></p><h2 id=kanye-west---nightmare><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Kanye West - Nightmare</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kanye West has had his ups and downs over the years. It seems like, these days, Kanye is making headlines for more bad things than good things. With so many controversies, it’s no wonder people aren’t exactly lining up to work with him. They say that all press is good press, but when it comes to Kanye, we’re not so sure about that.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=danielle-bregoli-aka-bhad-bhabie---nightmare><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Danielle Bregoli aka Bhad Bhabie - Nightmare</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Gaining your fame from an appearance on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Dr. Phil</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, before your rap career even begins, might not be the best way to start a career. It’s no wonder people really don’t take her seriously. She is making a name for herself in the rap world. However, she even has beef with Instagram star, Whoa Vicky.</span></p><h2 id=tekashi-6ix9ine---nightmare><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Tekashi 6ix9ine - Nightmare</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>You’d have to be living under a rock not to know what’s going on with Tekashi 6ix9ine. The rapper is in a boatload of legal troubles and has been making headlines because of his court hearings (for a number of charges). With all this bad media surrounding him, of course he’d be a nightmare to work with!</span></p><h2 id=azealia-banks---nightmare><span class=item-num>2 </span><span><span style=font-weight:400>Azealia</span> Banks - Nightmare</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Azealia Banks is infamous for getting into fights — specifically through Twitter — with other celebrities. She’s called out, and had beef with, people like Lana Del Rey, Cardi B, Rihanna, and Zayn Malik, just to name a few of the many she’s fought with. Most of the time, there’s never really a reason behind it, so as an artist, we’d stay far away.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=iggy-azalea---nightmare><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Iggy Azalea - Nightmare</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Over the years, Iggy Azalea has had her fair share of controversies, particularly over some comments that she made that many found insensitive. Many have accused her of cultural appropriation, and as a result, cast her in a bad light. We wouldn’t blame artists for not wanting to get involved.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhobmWilr2xsdGsZLCgn2Kus7GMraatmZxiwLixxK2fnpmiqcBurc2dZG5lp528bq3RnmSaZZ6etKnAzJqpnmWkpHq4u9GkZLChpJ18</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
