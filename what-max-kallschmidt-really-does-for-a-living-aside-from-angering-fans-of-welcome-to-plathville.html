Even though the TLC star claims to feel like he is "Mr. Misunderstood," fans aren't willing to give him a second chance. This is thanks in large part to his breakup from fan-favorite Moriah Plath and the way he's handled himself since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Welcome To Plathville's Micah Plat Got Absolutely Ripped</a></span></p><p>Max was first introduced on Welcome To Plathville fans in season 2 as Moriah's long-term boyfriend. Fans got front-seat views of the couple's transition from close friends to dating, and it really seemed like the two were head-over-heels in love with each other. Even Moriah's notoriously strict parents, Kim and Barry Plath, willingly and happily welcomed Max into the family.</p><p>In season 3, Max gifted Moriah a promise ring, promising to marry her one day. It seemed like everything was peachy for the couple, but sadly, it wasn't the case. Despite becoming an important member of the cast of the reality tv show, Max isn't going to be appearing on the show anytime soon.</p><p>While fans are certainly team Moriah, they still are curious about what Max has been up to post-Welcome to Plathville.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-max-kallschmidt-doing-post-welcome-to-plathville>What Is Max Kallschmidt Doing Post Welcome To Plathville?</h2><p>Max Kallschmidt made sure to get his side of the story out after not being featured in future seasons of Welcome to Plathville. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The reality star made a Youtube page</a> where he explained his view of what happened with Moriah and the cause of their breakup.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/untitled-design-95-1.jpg><p>Fans weren't exactly thrilled with his response, with<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> many of them actually becoming angry with Max</a>. He didn't seem to have any sympathy for Moriah and was flippant during the discussion of his infidelity.</p><p>During the video, he said he felt a lot of pressure from Moriah to move in with her, Ethan, and Olivia after they moved from Cairo to Florida. He did claim that he and Moriah remained friends after the breakup, and while there was definitely some tension between them at first, it seems like he is still friendly with Moriah and her family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On Instagram, he was even spotted wishing Moriah's younger sister, Lydia, happy birthday. Despite their parent's strict rules, <a href=#>most of the kids do have Instagram</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/untitled-design-96-1.jpg><p>Max has moved on from his Welcome To Plathville days, with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his Instagram account</a> now dedicated to posting pictures and videos of the fun times he's having with friends and family. He's also been traveling a lot and most recently being spotted checking out San Francisco.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans on Reddit have long questioned Max's real reasoning for going on the show</a> and dating Moriah. Some feel that he came on purely for fame and to promote his businesses, but considering his YouTube channel hasn't been updated since posting his video about the breakup, his intentions might have been purer than skeptics think. He appears to be single but hasn't commented on his relationship status.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=has-moriah-plath-moved-on-after-her-breakup-with-max-kallschmidt>Has Moriah Plath Moved On After Her Breakup With Max Kallschmidt?</h2><p>Moriah hasn't moved on from her breakup with Max, but she doesn't seem to be as strung up on it as she once was. Given that Max was Moriah's first kiss and first boyfriend, chances are she's going to need some time to get over the hurt caused by the relationship ending.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Welcome-To-Plathville-Cast.jpg><p>We don't know what she did with the promise ring she received from Max either, but she's definitely not wearing it anymore. During season three, Moriah was often seen crying over the breakup and even took to writing some devastatingly sad songs about it.</p><p>But Moriah was much less held down by the breakup in season four, even taking time to go on a few dates. If anything, her breakup from Max helped Moriah understand what she's looking for in a man.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Welcome To Plathville': Has Ethan Reconciled With Kim & Barry?</a></span></p><p>Fans think that the breakup is what's best for Moriah, despite how hurt she was by it. There were many discussions on Twitter and Reddit where fans questioned the toxicity of the pair's relationship. They were both incredibly young and naive when they entered their courtship.</p><p>Some people thought Max was too controlling of Moriah as well, with him often commenting about what she should or shouldn't wear.</p><h2 id=what-is-welcome-to-plathville-about>What Is Welcome To Plathville About?</h2><p>The reality show Welcome to Plathville premiered on TLC in 2019 and follows the lives of the Plath family.
