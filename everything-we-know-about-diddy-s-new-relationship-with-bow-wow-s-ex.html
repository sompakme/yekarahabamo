Short of a caption that calls her his girlfriend, Diddy and Joie have already gone Instagram official, and the world is starting to connect the dots between this relationship and <a href=#>another high profile relationship</a> that Joie has been involved in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For those who are just tuning in and trying to sort this out, the simple truth is that Joie also used to date Bow Wow. In fact, she's the mother of his child. Interestingly, she and Diddy have been off doing their own thing, which as of late, has involved a whole lot of PDA. Diddy and Joie aren't saying too much about their relationship just yet, but Cheatsheet indicates that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they're already pretty deeply involved.</a> Here's everything you need to know about how their relationship is evolving...</p><h2 id=bow-wow-outted-their-relationship><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Bow Wow Outted Their Relationship</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Diddy and Joie have actually been so silent about their relationship that they're not the ones who actually revealed it to the world in the first place. News of these two being an actual item came from Joie's ex and the father of her child, Bow Wow. He was the first to speak out and refer to them as a couple in a formal way, in essence outting them to the world well before they had a chance to speak out on their own accord.</p><p>Bow Wow released a statement indicating that they had his "blessing," and that he had made peace with their union, making fans raise an eyebrow to the fact that this was in fact a real relationship they were sharing and not just a hookup.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Diddy, Jermaine Dupri, And Dr. Dre Are Part Of A Weird Battle Triangle</a></span></p><h2 id=there-39-s-a-wee-bit-of-an-age-gap><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>There's A Wee Bit Of An Age Gap</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When assessing the relationship between Diddy and Joie, perhaps the most glaring thing that comes to the surface is the fact that there's quite an age gap between them. Diddy has marked his 51st birthday, and although he may not look it at first glance, he's far older than his now-girlfriend, Joie Chavis. Urban Islandz draws attention to the fact that Joie is a freshly new 34-years-old, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">making them a whopping 17-years apart</a>. That's a pretty substantial age gap, and it's one of the first things that came to mind when fans realized they seemed to be serious about one another.</p><h2 id=it-39-s-a-bit-of-a-dating-pyramid><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>It's A Bit Of A Dating Pyramid</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The story of Diddy dating Joie isn't really as simple as just the two of them. There seems to be a dating pyramid going on, and it's a twisted web that's been weaved. For starters, Joie shares a child with Bow Wow, and she also happens to share a child with Future. Diddy just ended a relationship with Steve Harvey's stepdaughter, Lori Harvey, and has also been connected to <a href=#>the mother of 50 Cent's child, Daphne Joy</a>. For the fans that are finding it hard to keep track, you're not alone. It seems the dating pyramid is a closely connected one, and it reads like a who's who in the world of entertainment.</p><h2 id=bow-wow-and-diddy-had-a-long-talk-about-this><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Bow Wow And Diddy Had A Long Talk About This</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of Diddy and Joie's relationship, is the fact that Diddy and Bow Wow have discussed it at length between one another. During the interview in which Bow Wow ousted Diddy and Joie as being an official couple, he also went on to indicate that he had spoken to his ex about what her relationship with Diddy was. Bow Wow went on to indicate that he and Diddy spent over an hour and 15 minutes discussing this topic with one another and eventually agreed to disagree. When asked about the nature of their conversation Bow Wow stated, “I just look at things differently.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Diddy Tries To Play Neutral But Clearly Favors Kanye West Over Drake In Recent Video</a></span></p><h2 id=bow-wow-isn-39-t-thrilled-but-he-39-s-accepting><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Bow Wow Isn't Thrilled, But He's Accepting</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's apparent that Bow Wow isn't thrilled with this situation, but he seems to be respectful of the fact that Diddy and Joie have opted to explore a relationship with one another and is at the very least, accepting of the fact that they're giving this a whirl. He recently took to social media to reveal that the real reason he isn't too concerned at the moment is that he "doesn't hear wedding bells ringing," suggesting that if the two were to surprise him and actually take a serious step towards spending their lives together in a permanent way, he'd likely be far less supportive and have way more to say about the matter than he currently does.</p><h2 id=they-took-a-romantic-trip-to-italy><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>They Took A Romantic Trip To Italy</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One thing that can be reported about Diddy and Joie with all certainty is the fact that they embarked on a very, very romantic trip to Italy together. Just last month, the two lovebirds were spotted making out and putting on a huge show of PDA for the cameras while enjoying some intimate time together on a yacht in Italy. They seemed to be so engrossed in one another that they had no idea they were steaming up the cameras of onlookers. This was the first moment that the world really took notice of the fact that they were an item.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything Diddy's Twin Daughters D'Lila And Jessie Have Achieved Since Their Mom's Passing</a></span></p><h2 id=they-haven-39-t-publicly-spoken-about-their-relationship><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>They Haven't Publicly Spoken About Their Relationship</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Interestingly, neither Diddy nor Joie have spoken publicly about their relationship. They've appeared on one another's social media posts from time to time but they have skipped over the part where they announce that they are a hot item, making fans wonder if they're really serious about one another or just enjoying their time while it lasts. They've both had ample opportunities to declare this relationship as being official but neither of them has come out and put a label on anything just yet.</p><h2 id=diddy-doted-on-joie-chavis-on-her-birthday><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Diddy Doted On Joie Chavis On Her Birthday</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Diddy may not be publicly speaking about how he feels about Joie Chavis, but he certainly stepped up to the plate on her birthday by throwing her a lavish birthday party. Diddy made sure everything was top notch for Joie and made sure that her special day was celebrated in style. In spite of the fact that he hasn't revealed details in a formal interview, Diddy's posts are doing all the talking, as he wished Joie a wonderful birthday and referred to her as "Queen" throughout his birthday post..</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The LGBTQ Community Is Outraged As Fans Troll Diddy's Comment To Lil Nas X</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicr52irsGptc2gZLCdXaC7sMOMmpmoraRisaqww7KqZqaVrHqzscuaq6Knnqi1qryMsKCtoF2XvLh51qiurGWVrXqru8ieZJygkau2tHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
