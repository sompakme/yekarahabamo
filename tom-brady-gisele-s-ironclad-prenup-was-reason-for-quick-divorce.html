But fans were surprised when reports confirmed the pair were officially divorced at the end of October.</p><p>Given their combined net worth of over $700 million, fans assumed the divorce process could be long and messy for the long-time couple. Not to mention, they also had custody of their two children to work out.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>‘Game of Thrones’ Author George R. R. Martin Gives Northwestern $5 Million</a></span></p><p>But a new report says that <a href=#>the couple’s clear prenuptial agreement</a> is the reason their divorce was so quick and simple.</p><p>“There was an ironclad prenup set down before they married in 2009,” a source told <a href=#>Page Six</a> . “They both have their own separate business entities, so the separation of their wealth wasn’t that complicated in the end.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They continued, “The only other major factor was dividing up their massive property portfolio.”</p><p>Tom is reportedly keeping their $17 million mansion, which is currently under construction in Indian Creek Island, Miami.</p><p>Gisele is keeping their home in Costa Rica, which they’ve historically used as a vacation property. She also just bought a $1.25 million home in Miami Beach, which reports say she’s going to use as an office.</p><p>Sources told <a href=#>Page Six</a> that the supermodel also purchased another home in Miami recently, though the details are under wraps. She’ll likely use the home as her main residence.</p><p>In February, Tom announced his return to the NFL only weeks after retiring. The news came after Tom had signed a 10-year, $370 million with FOX News to act as a senior football analyst.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shortly after, reports began circulating that his decision had caused trouble in their marriage. He allegedly failed to consult the model on his decision, despite promising to step back from football to focus on their family.</p><p>Gisele later gave an interview admitting she sacrificed a lot to support her husband’s career, but she’s looking forward to focusing on herself and their children moving forward.</p><p>After Tom signed the deal with FOX, sources said that <a href=#>Gisele wanted to renegotiate their prenup</a>. However, it may have only been speculation, considering how quickly they officialised their divorce, suggesting there was little to no disagreement about the division of assets.</p><p>Reports say that <a href=#>Tom didn’t want to end the marriage</a> and tried to salvage it, but unfortunately it didn’t work out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Eric Andre Launches Lawsuit Against Police After Racial Profiling At Airport</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Page Six</a>, <a href=#>Boston</a>, <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBsLmMm6manKlitKq%2FxKWcrGWZp7yvr8uam2aoopq7tryMsJisZaKarrS7zWadqKpdpsKqr8pmm6Kun6ewpns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
