She was an anchor/reporter on KOTA Rapid Zone, SD. She joined the WCHS-TV/WVAH-TV as a reporter and producer in March 2013. Before moving to the Mountain State, she spent two and a half years reporting, producing, and anchoring in Rapid City, S.D.</strong></p><p>She covered the passing of former U.S. Sen. Jim Abdnor and Native American activist Russell Means, one of the deadliest police shootings in Rapid City history, and the pine beetle epidemic plaguing the Black Hills. While at Newhouse, she was able to put my inquisitive nature to use by interning for Investigative Unit Correspondent Lisa Myers at NBC Nightly News in Washington, D.C.</p><p>When she is not bringing people news, she is baking, cooking, shopping, hiking, reading, practicing yoga, or snapping pictures around town. She has a furry child named Bailey. He is a very active and loving Yorkshire Terrier.</p><p>The passion for food stems from looking at mom in the kitchen. She likes to make food from scratch and post photos of her delicious meals on Facebook and Instagram.
