However, during the cross-examination, Bean revealed that he was inebriated and was struggling to stay wake as a result. “I’m so high right now, y’all,” the witness told those in the courtroom. “I’m ’bout to go to sleep on y’all a**. I ain’t gon’ tell a lie.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Bean’s declaration would prompt District Attorney Adriane Love, the lead prosecutor on the case, to offer his witness a bottle of water to assist with his hydration. Young Thug’s defense attorney Brian Steel asked if Bean needed time to gather himself, a proposal that was declined, with the witness opting to move forward with his testimony. “Let’s keep the ball rolling,” he said when asked if he wished to continue.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The YSL RICO trial has been one of the more eventful trials to attract the attention of rap fans in recent memory, as the proceedings have included various head-scratching moments that bordered on peculiar, to say the least. At one point, Young Thug was <a href=#>accused of being handed a Percocet</a> pill by a co-defendant in the courtroom, with the alleged transaction being caught on tape and surfacing on social media.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In November, prosecutors <a href=#>cited the Unabomber’s manifesto</a> in its argument to have alleged incriminating rap lyrics by Young Thug used against him at trial, arguing that those rhymes and Timothy McVeigh’s written admission were one in the same.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Gang lyric evidence pertaining to the predicate offenses, YSL, its rivals, expectations, and behaviors are all highly pertinent to the defendants’ states of mind and intent in this case,” read a motion filed by the prosecution.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1346327770.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Taken to its logical outcome, the defense would seem to opine that if the Unabomber’s manifesto had been set to music, it could not be used against him in any court. According to the defense’s argument, had the Turner Diaries been read with background music, it could not have been introduced against Timothy McVeigh.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Young Thug, born Jeffery Williams, was arrested in May 2002 and is said to be a founder of YSL, which the state has painted as a murderous gang that terrorized the streets of Atlanta for more than a decade.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Among the offenses, Young Thug is accused of include conspiracy to violate the state RICO Act, possession of drugs with intent to distribute, possession of firearms, and three counts of being a person employed or associated with a criminal street gang to conduct or participate in criminal gang activity through the commission of a crime.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-876759846.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX668trrGZquhrZdiv6qvzmarq6GRoXq4tdOnnKyrXZeyqrrGZp%2Bin5hiwaa%2F06KkqKapYn5zf5NxbWttYmt8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
