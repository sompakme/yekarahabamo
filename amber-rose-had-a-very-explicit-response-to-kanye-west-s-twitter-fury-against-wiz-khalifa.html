After the Taylor Gang rapper <a href=#>expressed his discontent for West’s album title change</a> to Waves, Yeezy offered a lengthy retort. Bashing Wiz’s music, his relationship with <a href=# id=auto-tag_amber-rose_1 data-tag=amber-rose>Amber Rose</a>, and even taunting him by saying he “owns” Wiz’s son Sebastian, West’s rant was anything but tame.</p><p>As the Internet flooded with reactions to West’s comments, Amber Rose took to Twitter with a clap back of her own, and she followed suit with a similar lack of chill:</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Awww <a href=# rel=nofollow>@kanyewest</a> are u mad I’m not around to play in ur asshole anymore? <a href=# rel=nofollow>#FingersInTheBootyAssBitch</a>?</p><p>— Amber Rose (@DaRealAmberRose) <a href=# rel=nofollow>January 27, 2016</a></p><p>This is not the first time in recent history that West has spewed less-than-favorable remarks about Rose. During a <a href=#>sit-down on Power 105.1’s The Breakfast Club</a> last year, West said, “If Kim had dated me when I wanted, there would be no Amber Rose,” and later noted that he had to take “30 showers” before dating Kim Kardashian. Rose embarked on a SlutWalk in L.A. to campaign against slut-shaming and rape culture later that year, and gave an <a href=#>emotional speech</a> that included West’s comments.</p><p>“Unfortunately, I was extremely slut shamed. I was called ‘nothing but a stripper.’ [He said] why would he ever be interested in me, I’m just a bald-head stripper from Philly,” Amber said of West. “I was a golddigger; apparently he had to take 30 showers after being with me. That’s what he said. I get that just washed all my sexy bald-headedness off of his ass.”</p><p>Following the social media firestorm of his rant, West deleted his tweets from his profile:</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Ima take these down cause it’s all about positive energy blessings blessings positive energy blessings</p><p>— KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) <a href=# rel=nofollow>January 27, 2016</a></p><p>Man it’s a sad a day… Wiz lost 2 million followers since I tweeted I didn’t mean to either him like that. — KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) <a href=# rel=nofollow>January 27, 2016</a></p><p>And Amber had this to say:</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Lol <a href=# rel=nofollow>@kanyewest</a> Now u wanna delete ur tweets cuz Muva has arrived? <a href=# rel=nofollow>#TwitterFingers</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>#UrGettingBodiedByAStripperNigga</a></p><p>— Amber Rose (@DaRealAmberRose) <a href=# rel=nofollow>January 27, 2016</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5a6o7HRZqmoq5Viv6a%2Fz6ilnatdoK6vxcRmrp6rpGLEqsaMpJ%2BapJmbrm6uxJ6dZmxgZoByf44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
