The 26-year-old country singer was <a href=#>named the winner of Season 16</a> of the ABC reality dance competition on Tuesday, May 21.</p><p>"I'm overwhelmed with joy," Pickler told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> after the show. "I'm kind of speechless for the first time! Usually I can't be quiet! Usually I'm just spitting out words left and right, and now I don't know what to say."</p><p>In the <a href=#>first-ever finale with four finalists</a>, Pickler beat out Disney star <strong>Zendaya</strong>, Baltimore Ravens wide receiver <strong>Jacoby Jones</strong> and Olympic gymnast <strong>Aly Raisman</strong> for the coveted Mirror Ball trophy.</p><p>"I was shocked to have made it this far," the "Best Days of Your Life" singer explained to Us. "We've made so many memories out here on this dance floor and in the studio. We've all worked so hard to be her, and it's just overwhelming. But in a great way."</p><p>Pickler's husband <strong>Kyle Jacobs</strong> was also overwhelmed by his wife's victory â€” and shed a few tears!</p><p>"I was like, 'Baby, were you crying?' And he was like, 'Oh, I had something in my eye. I got some confetti in my eye . . . ' He was so proud," she shared. "The first thing he said tonight was, 'Baby, I love you and I'm so proud of you. You did it.'"</p><p>And Pickler won't be hanging up her dancing shoes just yet. "I told him that if he didn't take dance classes with me, I'd have to find a rent-a-husband!" she joked.</p><p>But that won't be necessary! Jacobs told Us that he will "man up" and dance with his wife. "I'll definitely have to take a dance class," the songwriter said. "We're going to take them together."&nbsp;</p><p>"For a girl who has never danced, to win Dancing with the Stars is absolutely phenomenal," he added. "As her husband, I could not be more proud."&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In honor of Pickler's time on Dancing With the Stars, the couple even named their new puppy "Tango."&nbsp;</p><p>"It's not official!" Jacobs said. "But it's Tango for right now."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKepJyesm68yJyipZ2iYsSqutJmm5qmk567qHnWoquhZaSdsm6%2F05qprGWdrnqpwdKbmKecXZi%2FqrHDZmlpaWNnf3Z7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
