Mostly focused on family-friendly shows that were safe for children to watch, there was a variety of relatable shows which featured young stars that quickly became icons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whether the shows were focused around family, school or relationships, there was something for everyone to enjoy. However, as the shows slowly began to be removed from the air, the stars of the shows grew up and apart from their former identities. In some cases, these actors are incredibly hard to track down and keep tabs on. But some are much easier to recognize, particularly because they have grown away from their past and become absolute bombshells!</p><p>Kick back and think about the TGIF lineup, and have a look at <strong>20 TV Kids From The 90s Who Grew Up To Become Total Bombshells:</strong></p><h2 id=mary-kate-ashley-olsen---full-house><span class=item-num>20 </span><span><strong>Mary Kate/Ashley Olsen - Full House</strong></span></h2><p>At one time considered the world's most famous twins, Mary-Kate and Ashley were pop culture icons for playing the quick-witted Michelle Tanner on Full House. While not just incredibly cute child actresses, it was their charisma which made Michelle such a popular character.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Having since moved on from their Full House role - including not accepting a part on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fuller House</a> - the twins have not only grown into gorgeous women, but have become fashion moguls. You got it, dude!</p><h2 id=danielle-fishel---boy-meets-world><span class=item-num>19 </span><span><strong>Danielle Fishel - Boy Meets World</strong></span></h2><p>There are very few people who can honestly admit they did not have a crush on Topanga Lawrence from Boy Meets World. Her girl-next-door persona combined with her intelligence made her a dream girl for those who watched the show.</p><p>The most comforting thing to discover is that despite not being a part of the show since the 2000s, Danielle Fishel has not only maintained her good looks, but may have actually become more attractive with age.</p><h2 id=lacey-chabert---party-of-five><span class=item-num>18 </span><span><strong>Lacey Chabert - Party Of Five</strong></span></h2><p>In what may be one of the true "ugly duckling" stories of 90s television, very few people thought that little Claudia Salinger would grow up to be such a beautiful swan. The dorky middle child of Party of Five was not noticed by many during her time in the series, but once Lacey Chabert grew up, it became very difficult not to notice her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She may spend most of her time in Hallmark movies these days, but her beauty actually make some of those films worth watching (which is certainly saying something!).</p><h2 id=jodie-sweetin---full-house><span class=item-num>17 </span><span><strong>Jodie Sweetin - Full House</strong></span></h2><p>When Full House went off the air in 1995, there were not many people who kept tabs on the cast afterwards. Some went off into obscurity, and others tried hard to stay in the public eye, however most former fans did not seem to care.</p><p>That was until the&nbsp;Fuller House spin-off appeared in 2016 and people said "Wow, how gorgeous did Stephanie Tanner get?". Jodie Sweetin certainly grew up from the dorky Tanner girl into someone that makes fans drool just at the sight of her.</p><h2 id=jennifer-love-hewitt---kids-incorporated><span class=item-num>16 </span><span><strong>Jennifer Love Hewitt - Kids Incorporated</strong></span></h2><p>Fans of '90s television know Love Hewitt for her time on Party of Five, but her career started long before she was a teen actress. She began as a ten year old actress on a show called Kids Incorporated, which focused on the musical talents of younger kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While her talent was undeniable on the show, no one could have known that she would eventually become <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TV Guide's</a>Sexiest Woman on Television. Now a mother of two, her status as a sex symbol has unfortunately diminished in the eyes of some, but all it takes is a quick look at this bombshell to remember why everyone loves her.</p><h2 id=christina-aguilera---the-mickey-mouse-club><span class=item-num>15 </span><span><strong>Christina Aguilera - The Mickey Mouse Club</strong></span></h2><p>Before she became an international pop sensation, Christina Aguilera was affectionately referred to as a "Mouseketeer". As a part of the New Mickey Mouse Club, Aguilera was paired with other promising teenage talents to perform sketch comedy, dances and song routines to introduce Disney cartoons.</p><p>While she has certainly surpassed this part of her career, her time on the show was prevalent as it also featured many A-list celebrities from today, like Britney Spears and Ryan Gosling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=melissa-joan-hart---sabrina-the-teenage-witch><span class=item-num>14 </span><span><strong>Melissa Joan Hart - Sabrina the Teenage Witch</strong></span></h2><p>Whether she was a wise-cracking witch or explaining it all as Clarissa, Melissa Joan Hart was all over child television in the 1990s. Her humor combined with her girl-next-door looks made her incredibly popular with audiences both male and female, and gave her a great career as a result.</p><p>These days, it almost seems as though Joan Hart hasn't even aged and could pass for a teenage witch even today. Everything that fans loved about her has maintained, and in some cases only gotten better with time.</p><h2 id=tatyana-ali---fresh-prince-of-bel-air><span class=item-num>13 </span><span><strong>Tatyana Ali - Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</strong></span></h2><p>Will Smith was the obvious star of Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, but as time moved on more fans started to turn towards his cousin, Ashley Banks. As Tatyana Ali grew older, more people began to notice her and she eventually tried to pivot her post-Fresh Prince career in to a music career.</p><p>While she never maintained her level of fame that she had on the show, she has certainly moved on from being the youngest Banks daughter, and has grown in to an absolute bombshell of a woman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=naya-rivera---the-royal-family><span class=item-num>12 </span><span><strong>Naya Rivera - The Royal Family</strong></span></h2><p>Naya Rivera did not receive her big break until she dawned a Cherrios uniform as Santana Lopez on Glee, but her career stretches much further back than that. No one would have guessed that the young Hilary Winston on The Royal Family would grow in to someone that is drooled over in a cheerleader uniform.</p><p>Thankfully, life has a tendency to bring forward former child stars who have grown up to be absolutely gorgeous women on television and film.</p><h2 id=andrea-barber---full-house><span class=item-num>11 </span><span><strong>Andrea Barber - Full House</strong></span></h2><p>If anyone would have said that smelly Kimmy Gibbler would one day grow up to be an absolutely beautiful women who people would fawn over, most Full House fans would have said "how rude". Yet, in 2019 Andrea Barber has surprised so many by dropping people's jaws at just how gorgeous she became as an adult. It makes it pretty difficult to go back and think about how much viewers despised her on the show!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tia-tamara-mowry---sister-sister><span class=item-num>10 </span><span><strong>Tia/Tamara Mowry - Sister, Sister</strong></span></h2><p>Double the quick-talking and wise-cracking trouble, the Mowry twins proved that the Olsen twins were not the only 90's twins that could rule the TGIF lineup. Through all of their appearances on shows - both together and separate - it was a pleasure to see these two grow up on television. While their careers never took them to the A-list, they are still considered landmark actresses for their time.</p><h2 id=michelle-trachtenberg---all-my-children><span class=item-num>9 </span><span><strong>Michelle Trachtenberg - All My Children</strong></span></h2><p>As possibly the youngest person on this list, Michelle Trachtenberg&nbsp; began her on-screen career as a very young child in the 90s on the soap opera circuit. She gained further prominence in her teenage years on shows like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>, but was never a very well-liked character.</p><p>However, absence makes the heart grow fonder, as Trachtenberg's movement away from the spotlight has made fans question why they were so mean to her in the first place. Perhaps a triumphant return is in order to show how much she has grown up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jenna-von-oy---blossom><span class=item-num>8 </span><span><strong>Jenna von Oy - Blossom</strong></span></h2><p>If any readers are not reading this entry&nbsp;incredibly fast-paced, they do not remember who Jenna von Oy is. As the fast-talking Six on Blossom, von Oy was a very polarizing character on the show. Some may have appreciated her wit, but others found her far too annoying to comprehend.</p><p>Thankfully, she has shed her controversial character and has become a beautiful woman still on search of a musical career. Not many remember her for her time on Blossom, but all she has to do is talk fast to remind them.</p><h2 id=claire-danes---my-so-called-life><span class=item-num>7 </span><span><strong>Claire Danes - My So-Called Life</strong></span></h2><p>When a former child actor becomes successful later in life, some can often forget that they had a career in the 90s. However, before she became a hardened CIA officer on Homeland, she was the moody and brooding teenager Angela Chase on My So Called Life.</p><p>Now achieving cult-like status, Claire Danes helped young women connect to the not-so-happy times of being a teenage girl. Now, hopefully younger woman can look at her and see that she overcame those hardships and blossomed into a beautiful woman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=linda-cardellini---boy-meets-world><span class=item-num>6 </span><span><strong>Linda Cardellini - Boy Meets World</strong></span></h2><p>Boy Meets World fans do not like to remember that Linda Cardellini had a part on the show, as she was responsible for breaking up Cory and Topanga from what was considered one of the greatest teenage on-screen romances. However, one look at her now and it would be easy to understand if Cory walked away from Topanga in a heartbeat.</p><p>She may have only had a two episode stint on the show, but she made a lasting impact on fans, and continues to with her on-screen roles today.</p><h2 id=mackenzie-rosman---7th-heaven><span class=item-num>5 </span><span><strong>Mackenzie Rosman - 7th Heaven</strong></span></h2><p>It may be hard to fathom, but Ruthie Camden from 7th Heaven is now almost thirty years old, and has become an absolute stunner! It may be difficult to picture her outside of the Reverend's household, but she has been working hard to shed her former identity.</p><p>Would Reverend Camden approve of her posing in Maxim in 2013? Likely not, but fans who couldn't believe how gorgeous she grew up to be sure did!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=danica-mckellar---the-wonder-years><span class=item-num>4 </span><span><strong>Danica McKellar - The Wonder Years</strong></span></h2><p>The girl-next-door archetype was well utilized on 90s television, and certainly made an impression on those watching the show. Was there anyone who embodied the girl-best friend better than Danica McKellar? Alongside Fred Savage in The Wonder Years, fans watched her grow up and become more attractive on television, but were even more surprised when she showed up on How I Met Your Mother as an absolute bombshell!</p><h2 id=jurnee-smollett-bell---full-house><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><strong>Jurnee Smollett-Bell - Full House</strong></span></h2><p>It may be difficult to remember where fans remember Jurnee Smollett-Bell from, but it jumps in to mind the moment she flashes her gorgeous smile. As Stephanie Tanner's smack-talking friend, she was a supporting character to the Tanner family on Full House for many years, but has grown up and wouldn't be cast aside anymore. Her career may not be as prolific as others on this list, but she certainly has grown up!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=soleil-moon-frye---punky-brewster><span class=item-num>2 </span><span><strong>Soleil Moon Frye - Punky Brewster</strong></span></h2><p>Punky Brewster was not known for being a ratings juggernaut, but was a show that connected well with kids because of the spunky star of the show. For a show centered around a precocious child in social care, it featured a lot of humor and the character was very popular with children.</p><p>Despite not maintaining a high profile career on screen, Soleil Moon Frye is still recognizable for her role, and a great success story as a parent to her children. Not to mention, she certainly grew out of her awkward stage very nicely.</p><h2 id=larisa-oleynik---the-secret-world-of-alex-mack><span class=item-num>1 </span><span><strong>Larisa Oleynik - The Secret World Of Alex Mack</strong></span></h2><p>Described by many as one the most down-to-Earth people to ever move away from the spotlight of 90s television, Larisa Oleynik does not mention her former television roles often, and prefers to keep them in the past.</p><p>However, fans of her former roles remember her fondly and love what she has grown up to be - a strong, smart, independent woman (even if she can't really turn herself in to a puddle like Alex Mack).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhpaWWkq3qstcOsZJ%2Bqn6J6tbTEZnBpq12stbB5xqucsGWlpXq1u4ybnJynnZp6tbvTmqNmmp%2Bir7S0xKWjrGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
