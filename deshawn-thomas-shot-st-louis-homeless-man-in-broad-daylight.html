The graphic video shows the amateur shooter struggling to load his gun before he callously shoots the homeless man in the head.&nbsp;</p><p>The victim, who is yet to be identified, showed no signs of struggle except raising his hands, and it appeared as if he resigned to his fate.&nbsp;</p><p>A bystander made a video showing Thomas approaching the victim while he was sitting on the curb and shooting him from the back.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“Oh, my god. He just f*cking killed him,”</strong> the witness can be heard saying.</p><p>The shooting happened in the heart of downtown St. Louis Monday at around 10 a.m., police said.</p><p>Major Ryan Cousins told the St. Louis Dispatch at the scene, <strong>“Any homicide is unnerving, but for this one to happen here, at this time, very much so.”</strong></p><p>The victim, whose name has not been released, had dodged off Thomas at a Shell gas station just minutes before. Thomas then chased him across the street before allegedly shooting him, police said.</p><p>Major Cousins said the victim is likely in his 40s but didn’t provide more details about him. The video was posted on Twitter but was later taken down due to its graphic nature.</p><p>As expected, Thomas flew to the scene immediately after committing this heinous crime, but the police caught him at a local library on the same day.&nbsp;</p><p>Officials say he was found with a gun and a bullet casing.</p><p>The bystander who made and posted the graphic video on Twitter asked Twitter to stop censoring it as it does not show the murder on camera.&nbsp;</p><p>He posted the video again after Twitter removed it for the first time.&nbsp;</p><p>Deshawn Thomas, who is under police custody, has now been charged with murder of first degree.&nbsp;</p><p>Missouri’s US Senator Josh Hawley used the incident to criticize Kim Gardner, the local circuit attorney for the city of St Louis.</p><p>He demanded Gardner’s resignation in a series of tweets.&nbsp;</p><p>The local official has been embroiled in controversy since an armed robbery suspect with several house arrest violations was behind the wheel in a crash over earlier this month, which forced a 17-year-old to suffer a double amputation.</p><p>Crimes are being committed in broad daylight in the city of St. Louis. This is high time for the local government to take strict action to ensure peace and safety prevail in all the city’s neighborhoods.&nbsp;</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCwxKyfmq%2BeYsGpu8yaqmarmKTBbr%2FTZqOorZmoeqm7zJ6jnqujYrqiuo4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
