She also reveals that she took a massive pay cut when she joined the company.</p><p>Speaking on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Power Alphas Podcast</a>, Macey Estrella, formerly known as Lacey Evans in WWE, described how she is addicted to hustling and making things work. She noted that this drive led her to WWE, and she detailed how success is subjective. Evans then recalled how she almost got into fights several times in WWE.</p><p>“Success to me, and I’m gonna piss a lot of people off, I don’t give a sh*t,” Lacey Evans said. “You can’t cancel me at this point. Not that I gave a sh*t to begin with. Back then, how I lasted seven years in WWE, I have no idea. My mouth was the same one backstage. I can’t tell you how many damn fights I almost got into, and I verbally told them every time, I’ll work at McDonald’s before I ever sit back and have anybody talk to me the way that you’re talking to me because you feel like I owe you something.</p><p>“The only thing I owe you is working my ass off to have a good match. Back here, there’s no damn way that I’m gonna let anybody talk to me….It’s been a few times, but luckily the powers that be liked me enough to, each year, I just got a little bit more, and WWE’s been great to me. They’ve been awesome. I’ve invested every bit of my money. I have investment properties, real estate, I’ve got a full business paid for. I’m in a good place because I was smart.”</p><h2 id=h-lacey-evans-talks-asking-for-her-release>Lacey Evans Talks Asking For Her Release</h2><p>Lacey Evans continued by explaining how “alphas” aren’t always the ones holding titles. She then commented on asking for her WWE release, as she noted that she didn’t want to sit in catering.</p><p>“Sometimes, it’s the one that never got to touch that sh*t because we are alphas. I’m not standing outside of doors anymore, waiting on answer that whoever the powers that be can’t even look me in the eye and tell me,” Lacey Evans said. “I don’t got time for that. I got babies to feed and a husband to please, and I’ll be damned if I’m gonna live like that and have people talk to me a certain way because they feel like I owe, I don’t owe anybody a damn thing because I work hard. I work my ass off every day.</p><p>“So if they can’t make a decision, I will, and I asked for my release. I asked, verbatim, can I slip out the side door because I’m addicted to not sitting in catering…I’m not doing it. I’m coming where I come from, and what I’ve been through, and what I’ve had to do. Nobody’s gonna talk to me any certain way. I’m not gonna sit my ass in catering eating steak anymore. Love the catering, by the way. It’s incredible. With this alpha mentality, I’ve gotta be making moves. If you don’t see me as a top guy and you have the ability to make that choice, let me go because I know where I’m a top guy. I know where I thrive the most, and I’m a thriver. I gotta go.”</p><h2 id=h-lacey-evans-on-taking-a-pay-cut-to-be-in-wwe>Lacey Evans On Taking A Pay Cut To Be In WWE</h2><p>Lacey Evans went on to describe how she took a pay cut to be in WWE. She noted that she was successful before she joined the company, but she wanted a platform so she could help people by talking abouy her background.</p><p>“I took a pay cut to even be in WWE, which is wild,” Lacey Evans said. “I’m thinking I could use my platform, right, that hustler mentality where I’m addicted. I want to help people so much so that that was my main goal in WWE. Because I’m an alpha, and I want to be able to tell my story, use my story and help people. I know what I’ve accomplished already. Before I even joined WWE, I had multiple properties, 18 acres, my family’s set up. I’ve got a military career, I run a construction company. But I don’t have the platform that I can help human beings in a sh*t ass situation where I come from. So in my mind, that was my main goal. I didn’t forsee myself holding a title up. That, to me, that doesn’t make me feel accomplished. To each his own, so this is my opinion. To me, holding that above my head is not what made me excited to wake up for. It was being able to make a difference, so much so to human beings’ lives. Which was wild because WWE is known for helping a lot of people and working with the military.</p><p>“But what about the ones of us that are sitting back there? That’s what tore me down the most. It wasn’t if I was over or if I got to go out…Can I at least make a damn difference while I’m sitting here? That was my question. What are we doing? If you don’t need me to run out there and flip-flop around and jump off ladders, which I will, I did. I ran with the best of the motherf**kers, and I didn’t even know how to do that sh*t. Then at least let me go and make a difference in the community. But it’s business, it’s a business. They don’t got time for that, that’s not their priority. They look at income ratio and what they can make money off of, and unfortunately, being able to discuss mental health and addiction and drugs and a sh*t ass life and a mentality like no other and being able to share that, they’re not gonna make money that way.”</p><p>Later in the interview, Evans noted that she was making six figures before she signed with WWE, and she took a “massive pay cut” when she joined the company.</p><p>The full podcast is available here:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNqa3BuZmK5oq%2FEsmSerpGjwG7AzqiiZpldoq60v8ivnGaoka56pMHTZq6hnZ5iwKmxjKOmoqaVmXq4w8RmpZ6ZoqHGbrPOrWSipl2btqi006w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
