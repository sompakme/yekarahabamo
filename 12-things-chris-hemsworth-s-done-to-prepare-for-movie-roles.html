He always makes time for his family, including his famous younger brother, Liam Hemsworth. Chris is also an avid lover of outdoor sports, such as dirt biking and surfing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Known for his Australian accent, his perfect smile, and his ability to make so many people who watch him on the big screen fall in love, Hemsworth is extremely dedicated to the art of acting. He has gone to great lengths to prepare for his big-screen roles, including the part of Thor.</p><p>When he's not transforming for roles, he's taking good care of his three kids and hanging out with his wife, Elsa Pataky.</p><h2 id=exercised><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Exercised</span></h2><p>Obviously, for the actor, exercise is a big part of life. Chris Hemsworth frequently jumps between cardio, circuit training, and muscle training to achieve the results that he wants.</p><p>In addition to exercising at the gym, Hemsworth enjoys outdoor activities, such as surfing and bike racing, which get his adrenaline pumping. Outdoor sports are a fun and creative way to exercise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=yoga><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Yoga</span></h2><p>Introduced to yoga by Robert Downey Jr. during the preparation for his role in Avengers (as Thor), Hemsworth picked up the relaxing activity to tone his body and keep his mind focused on goals. Yes, big and buff guys like Chris do yoga, too.</p><h2 id=took-a-beating><span class=item-num>10 </span><span><span class=related-single>Took A beating</span></span></h2><p>Turning into Thor, while preparing to film and during filming, took a big toll on Chris’s physical health. He claims that his joints really took a beating, according to Inquisitr, and said that he felt sore after his intense workout and filming routines.</p><p>His pain is actually what drove him to become yoga buddies with Robert Downey Jr.</p><h2 id=meditation><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Meditation</span></h2><p>Meditation for Hemsworth was not the usual escape from reality. Chris’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">meditation</a> involves “anything where you’re completely involved physically, pushing yourself to that point where you can’t think about anything because it’s all your physical response.” This means, exercise, including the aforementioned yoga and outdoor activities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sibling-rivalry><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Sibling Rivalry</span></h2><p>Sibling rivalry is super common in families with two or more boys who are close in age. This almost-friendly competition pushed Chris and Liam to try their best in auditions...and to land big roles.</p><p>Chris’s desire to one-up his brother Liam is what landed him the role of Thor. Up to that point,&nbsp; Liam was getting further along in the audition process than his brother, in a shorter period of time, and Chris wanted to do better.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>20 Times Sibling Rivalry Went Too Far</a></span></p><h2 id=losing-30-pounds-in-4-months><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Losing 30 Pounds In 4 Months</span></h2><p>For his role in Rush, Chris Hemsworth’s bulky figure that he developed while preparing for his role as Thor was not suitable for the role. The actor had to lose a lot of weight to actually fit into a vintage F1 car. F1 drivers are on the smaller side. Chris had to lose 30 pounds over the course of 4 months.</p><h2 id=regaining-the-30-lost-pounds><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Regaining The 30 Lost Pounds</span></h2><p>Right after his role in Rush, Chris had to go back and get into shape for his role as Thor. That purely means gaining back all the weight he lost while he was preparing for his role in Rush...and bringing back the ripped and defined muscles that Thor is known for.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=protein><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Protein</span></h2><p>Diet is always an important element when working on building lean muscle mass and getting the best results from training. Chris used this fact to his advantage by eating tons of red meat and other protein. His diet helped him to build muscle for his role as Thor.</p><h2 id=ate-broccoli-quinoa-and-brown-rice><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Ate Broccoli, Quinoa And Brown Rice</span></h2><p>In addition to focusing on protein, Chris had a few staple foods, such as broccoli, quinoa, and brown rice, which he ate frequently. He ate them with protein to add bulk. He also ate a ton of fruit, which helped his body to break down the protein. Fruit also made it easier for him to digest the other stuff that he was eating.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>16 Attractive Celebs In Yoga Pants We Can't Stop Staring At</a></span></p><h2 id=studied-mike-tyson><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Studied Mike Tyson</span></h2><p>Thor is known for being able to hold a hammer and use it efficiently. In order to prepare to perform the role convincingly, Chris watched Mike Tyson’s fights. These boxing matches help show him with what to do.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Chris was younger, one of the many professions that he was interested in was boxing. His love of fighting came long before his stint as Thor, and the actor seemed to look up to Mike Tyson.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here's What Happened To Mike Tyson's Tigers</a></span></p><h2 id=studied-shakespeare><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Studied Shakespeare</span></h2><p>Chris Hemsworth was <a href=#>given a monologue</a>&nbsp;to recite, which was the St. Crispin's Day monologue from Shakespeare's,&nbsp;Henry V. Director, Kenneth Branagh, gave him the speech in order to teach Hemsworth how to learn his lines quickly. He also wanted to teach him to speak properly, and use different voices, and adapt to different roles.</p><h2 id=never-gave-up><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Never Gave Up</span></h2><p>As you can see from the list above, Hemsworth dedicates a ton of time time to his art. He knows the rewards of perseverance and is not afraid to use his free time behind the scenes preparing for the moment when the camera starts rolling.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Chris Hemsworth Donates $1 Million To Help Fight The Fires in Australia</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhoa2Wknbavs9JmmqGqmah6qbHMrK6oqqSdwG6wzqecZqyfYr2zsc%2BaqZ5llqS%2FbrnOr6CeZaKkuaa%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
