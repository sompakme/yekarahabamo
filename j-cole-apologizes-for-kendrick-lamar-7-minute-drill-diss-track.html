Cole</a> has officially walked back his recent <a href=# id=auto-tag_kendrick-lamar data-tag=kendrick-lamar>Kendrick Lamar</a> diss. During his closing set at the fourth annual <a href=#>Dreamville Festival</a> on Sunday (April 7), the North Carolina rapper addressed how he regrets releasing his <a href=#>“7 Minute Drill” track</a>, which debuted on his Might Delete Later project just two days prior.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I damn near had a relapse… Y’all heard that bazooka that was dropped on the game, right?” he said to a sea of festival attendees. He was referencing <a href=#>K. Dot’s blockbuster “Like That” verse</a>, where Lamar took aim at <a href=# id=auto-tag_drake data-tag=drake>Drake</a> and Cole. The “No Role Modelz” rapper then explained how he felt pressured into responding, adding, “For the first time, I was tested. I got the world and I got my n**gas saying, ‘What you gon’ do Cole?'”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">J. Cole also expressed his appreciation for Drizzy and Kendrick, and he confirmed he had no actual beef with the latter in the first place. “I was conflicted because, I know my heart and I know how I feel about my peers, these two n**gas that I’m blessed to even stand beside in this game and let alone chase their greatness. I felt conflicted because I know I don’t really feel no way. But the world want to see blood,” he said. “I moved in a way that, spiritually, I feel bad.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>J. Cole apologizes to Kendrick Lamar for dissing him on ‘7 Minute Drill’ at Dreamville Fest…</p><p>“How many of y’all think Kendrick Lamar is one of the greatest ever to pick up a mic”</p><p>“I haven’t been sleeping right the last few days… Ib, we taking that diss off streaming… <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/gafW1g6Hw9</a></p>— NFR Podcast (@nfr_podcast) <a href=# rel=nofollow>April 8, 2024</a></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Elsewhere in his speech, he said Kendrick is one of the “greatest to ever touch a mic” and he’s prepared for K. Dot’s next step. “That was the lamest, goofiest sh*t… I pray that God aligns me back on my purpose and on my path,” he continued. “I pray that my n**ga didn’t really feel no way. And if he did, my n**ga I got my chin out. Take your best shot, I’ma take that sh*t on the chin. Boy, do what you do. All good.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The monologue ends with the Born Sinner spitter focusing on a positive future. “I pray that y’all forgive a n**ga for the misstep and I could get back to my true path… So all of that to say, I want to perform the song that’s a reminder to me of getting on the right path and getting in tune with God,” he concluded before performing “Love Yourz.” Watch the full speech above.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">On the aforementioned “7 Minute Drill” track, Cole shot at<a href=#> the Los Angeles native</a> by insinuating that To Pimp A Butterfly “put n**gas to sleep,” referenced the infamous 2013 “Control” verse, and more.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I came up in the ‘Ville, so I’m good when it’s tension/ He still doin’ shows, but fell off like&nbsp;the Simpsons/ Your first sh*t was classic, your last sh*t was tragic/ Your second sh*t put n**gas to sleep, but they gassed it/ Your third sh*t was massive and that was your prime/ I was trailin’ right behind and I just now hit mine,” he raps in verse one. “Now I’m front of the line with a comfortable lead/ How ironic, soon as I got it, now he want somethin’ with me/ Well, he caught me at the perfect time, jump up and see/ Boy, I got here off of bars, not no controversy.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Give “7 Minute Drill” from Might Delete Later a spin below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The 2024 Dreamville Festival took place on April 6-7 in Raleigh, NC, for its fourth iteration.
