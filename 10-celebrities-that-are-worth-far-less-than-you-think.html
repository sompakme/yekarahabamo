It seems that once someone is rich and famous, doors continuously open for them to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">generate even greater wealth</a>. Fans are fascinated by all the wealth that is generated but are oftentimes unaware of the fact that some of the world's most sought after, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">highest-paid celebrities</a> happen also to be squandering away their millions far faster than they can earn them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are many famous faces out there that have <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">generated millions upon millions of dollars</a> yet have a very modest net worth to show for it at this current time. According to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Go Banking Rates</a>, excessive shopping and high-priced nights out are among the most popular reasons that some celebrities haven't been able to hold on to their fortunes, as well as expensive real estate purchases and tax arrears, to name a few. Here are some high-profile figures that have some seriously low net worth valuations.</p><h2 id=chris-tucker-5-million>Chris Tucker: $5 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many may wonder how the start of Fifth Element and the infamous Rush Hour series could possibly be worth just $5 million, especially considering he was paid $20 million to appear in the Rush Hour sequel alone. However, he made <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">some huge real estate purchases</a> in 2011 and took a step back from acting, only to find himself facing a tax lien and other financial problems. His $5 million net worth valuation is certainly nothing to scoff at, but when compared to his actual earnings, it's sadly disappointing that he wasn't able to hold on to a bigger chunk of his wealth.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Now Infamous Lawyer Tom Girardi's Firm More Than $100 Million In Debt</a></span></p><h2 id=sinbad-4-million>Sinbad: $4 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sinbad has dominated both the stage and the small screen with his fabulously funny demeanor and comedic antics, but in spite of being stellar on camera, he's been far less&nbsp; successful when it comes to managing his money. He filed for bankruptcy twice, after accumulating an hefty debt load, owing $8.3 million due to the IRS, and nearly $400,000 due on his American Express card. He's now only worth $4 million.</p><h2 id=amanda-bynes-3-million>Amanda Bynes: $3 Million</h2><p>Amanda Bynes had a huge boost when it came to starting her acting career at a young age. She grew up in front of her fans and even starred in her very own show, called The Amanda Show, on Nickelodeon. She went on to do a series of well-received comedies such as What A Girl Wants, but it wasn't long before the child star crumbled under pressure. A very public and <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">incredibly dramatic mental breakdown</a> led to the demise of her career, and she lost most of her fortune without much hope to rekindle her work life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mike-tyson-3-million>Mike Tyson: $3 Million</h2><p>Arguably one of the greatest fighters of all time, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo News </a>reports that Tyson earned well over $300 million over the course of his wildly successful boxing career. However, he lost it after being entangled in a series of assault charges, issues with addiction, and legal fees. He spent far more than he earned by filed for bankruptcy in 2003. His current net worth is just $3 million, a fraction of his earnings, and far less relevant than his successful career would suggest.</p><h2 id=mc-hammer-2-million>MC Hammer: $2 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>MC Hammer dominated the airwaves in the 1990s, and people of all ages and walks of life knew exactly what "Hammer time" meant. MC Hammer's signature puffy pants and unmistakable lyrics shot him up to superstardom at a fast pace. At one point, he was worth well over $25 million, but after <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">buying a mansion</a> that included a 17 car garage, and a whole lot of staff to service his every need, MC Hammer lost most of his fortune through overspending. He was forced to file for bankruptcy and is currently only worth $2 million.</p><h2 id=lindsay-lohan-500-000>Lindsay Lohan: $500,000</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Notorious party girl Lindsay Lohan was once worth a whole lot more than her current $500,000. After spending much of her income on her lifestyle choices, she was left with very little, and the IRS wanted a big piece of her remaining assets. The choices Lohan made during the peak of her career wound up being the reason for her demise, as producers didn't want to risk working with her on a project that she couldn't see through or one that wouldn't do well due to her lack of commitment and focus. She has been having a hard time rebounding and reclaiming her throne.</p><h2 id=evander-holyfield-500-000>Evander Holyfield: $500,000</h2><p>Evander Holyfield has an astounding number of accolades and medals under his belt, including multiple <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">World Heavyweight Champion</a> wins. His prize money amounted to well over $230 million, yet somehow, his net worth is estimated at being roughly $500,00 today. He has invested in multiple properties but has failed to make his payments, resulting in foreclosures and other penalties. At one point, he had more money than he would ever need if he lived a normal lifestyle, but now, he's starting from the bottom and trying to rebuild.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=aaron-carter-2-million>Aaron Carter: $2 Million</h2><p>Aaron Carter's $2 million net worth is nothing to frown upon. Until it's compared with the fact that he had already earned well over $200 million by the time he was 18 years old. After realizing that fact, it becomes quickly apparent that he spent far more than he earned. His off-the-charts real estate purchases and inability to keep on top of his tax bills ended up draining his account, and he was only able to hold on to a fraction of what he made throughout his career.</p><h2 id=heidi-montag-20-000>Heidi Montag: $20,000</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Heidi Montag and her husband, Spencer Pratt, were raking in the dough when they starred on The Hills. Given that they both had <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">leading roles on the show</a>, it wasn't surprising to see them living lavishly and partying hard, but they definitely took things too far. After earning $2 million a year, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider</a> states that they ended up spending $3,000 on bottles of wine and spending over $15,000 on their date nights, along with stacking their closets full of $1 million worth of designer clothes. That liquidated their assets quickly, and they're now only worth $20,000.</p><h2 id=burt-reynolds-3-million>Burt Reynolds: $3 Million</h2><p>Burt Reynolds entertained the masses for well over three decades and was one of the biggest names in Hollywood. Sadly, after seeing success in the 60s, 70s <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanity Fair</a>, "I've lost more money than is possible because I just haven't watched it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He blew his earnings on a private jet, over 150 horses, and all kinds of personal obsessions that drained his account down to just $3 million, which is a far cry from what he should have to show for his 40+ years working in the industry.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is How DaBaby Earned $5 Million...
