I’m very proud of the work I did at Hallmark for 15 years and love all my friends there.”</p><p>She continued, “I’m more than an actor. Growth in my company as well as my achievements in business is extremely important to me.”</p><p>After a user asked on Wednesday whether Cameron Bure had any upcoming projects, she enthusiastically replied, “Yes!!”</p><p>“I have mystery movies coming out in the fall on Great American Family channel called The Ainsley McGregor Mysteries,” Cameron Bure wrote, sharing a pic of her from the set. (The network <a href=#>previously announced its movie franchise</a>, and Cameron Bure’s involvement, in February.)</p><p>She added, “I also have a new Christmas movie airing in November on Great American Family Channel called A Christmas Less Traveled.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Candace-Cameron-Bure-Says-She-Is-More-Than-Just-an-Actor-Defends-Decision-to-Leave-Hallmark-02.jpg><p>Cameron Bure noted that she’s also “prepping to shoot two more films” for Great American Family Channel in the summer, and gave a shout-out to her self-titled podcast — which will start releasing episodes for its seventh season next week. “Lots of surprises!!!!” she wrote.</p><p>The <a href=#>Full House alum</a> announced in April 2022 that she was pivoting to Great American Media, where she will also help oversee and curate programming for the network.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’m very excited to develop heartwarming family and faith-filled programming and make the kind of stories my family and I love to watch,” Cameron Bure <a href=#>said in a statement</a> at the time. “I am constantly looking for ways that I can inspire people to live life with purpose. GAC fits my brand perfectly; we share a vision of creating compelling wholesome content for an audience who wants to watch programming for and with the whole family.”</p><p>Cameron Bure subsequently noted that Hallmark had become “basically a completely different network” because of leadership changes. “I think that Great American Family will keep traditional marriage at the core,” she told WSJ Magazine in November 2022.</p><p>After <a href=#>receiving backlash for her remark</a>, Cameron Bure clarified via social media that she would never “intentionally want to offend or hurt anyone,” claiming she has “great love and affection for all people.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacmZ6ZrqSxjJyYpp2ipLturtSrnGaclZuyr7DSZqOemaaeu6h5x5qjpaWRp7huss6rZKCZk2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
