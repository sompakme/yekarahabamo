First, she looked angelic an all-white ensemble. She paired her corset top finished with sparkly buttons with a matching coat, sleek trousers and white pumps.</p><p>She later took her jacket off to give fans a closer look at her strapless top and accessories, including a white mini purse featuring a silver bow, dainty rings and chunky hoop earrings.</p><p>Next, Hale changed into a bubblegum pink button-down shirt and matching pants while interviewing with CBS Mornings. She elevated her monochrome fit with a long coat, a pastel purse finished with a braided strap and pointed-toe pumps.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lucy-Hale-Rocks-4-Classy-Outfits-in-1-Day-in-NYC-2.jpg><p>Hale’s makeup perfectly highlighted her fit. She donned light pink eyeshadow that made her fuchsia lips pop. Her glam was topped off with filled-in eyebrows, long lashes and rosy cheeks. Her brunette hair was parted down the middle and worn in a slicked-back updo with her curtain bangs framing her face.</p><p>The Pretty Little Liars alum’s fierce looks didn’t stop there. For an interview with The Today Show, she slipped into a fiery red two-piece that showed just the right amount of skin with a cropped plunging blazer top. Hale also gave fans a glimpse of her toned legs by rocking a flowy skirt featuring an oversized bow at her hip.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Hale finished her day off by wearing a cropped blouse from Lowe and a gray pleated skirt while making an appearance at the SAG-AFTRA Foundation Conversations. The skirt featured two sets of belt loops, making for a perfect excuse for Hale to double-up on the black leather accessory. She completed her look with black boots.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lucy-Hale-Rocks-4-Classy-Outfits-in-1-Day-in-NYC-3.jpg><p>The singer took down her updo and rocked her strands in soft curls.</p><p>Which Brings Me to You premieres in theaters on Friday, January 19.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6HCpMWMoZilnV2ssqK%2B0mZrZqelqbOqwNJmoKdlYWKxosWMsJ%2BipJVivLbAjKKlZqaVrHq6u9GkZJyhpK58</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
