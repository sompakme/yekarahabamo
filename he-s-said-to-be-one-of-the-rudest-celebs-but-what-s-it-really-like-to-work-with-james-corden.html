He went from only being known in the UK for a variety of different sitcoms, such as Gavin And Stacey, to taking over the US chat show scene in 2015 on The Late Late Show With James Corden.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, there have been many suggestions over the years from members of the public who have had dealings with him that the seemingly smiley and friendly chat show host that we see on our screens isn't actually like that off camera. But given that these are often one-off meetings, those who have actually worked with James have a completely different opinion of the star.</p><h2 id=is-james-corden-rude>Is James Corden Rude?</h2><p>It comes as no secret that there have been a number of different stories come out about James that don't show him in the best light, particularly when it comes to his dealings with the public.</p><p>This may well just be an issue of not knowing how to cope with his fame, or it could be the real person behind the mask of a friendly chat show host.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Are Critics Finally Getting Their Wish With James Corden Leaving Late Night TV?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For example, many of his fans went to watch recordings of The Late Late Show and said that <a href=#>during breaks in filming, he appeared cold</a> and like he didn't enjoy his job. He was said to have no interaction with the audience, which is apparently something many other chat show hosts will do, and only ever spoke to members of the band during this time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/james-corden-3.jpg><p>He was even banned and then unbanned from the New York restaurant <a href=#>Balthazar after the owner accepted his apology</a> for his 'abusive' behavior towards the restaurant's workers. Plus, who can forget that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit AMA thread</a> where many people called out James on his poor behavior towards them and others?</p><p>Going by all of those comments alone, it doesn't seem that James is the nice person that he portrays himself to be.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-it-like-to-work-with-james-corden>What Is It Like To Work With James Corden?</h2><p>Despite the dealings that many members of the public have had with him, it appears that those who have worked closest with James seem to have an entirely different opinion of him altogether. For example, Reggie Watts, who was the band leader on The Late Late Show has said that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he doesn't agree with how everyone else sees James</a>.</p><p>Whilst Reggie has admitted that the pair haven't spent much time with each other, aside from when they would be on-screen together, he has said that James is a really kind and considerate person; much like the person who is seen on TV.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/james-corden-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the interview with Metro, he said that any time that the two are together that James is really friendly towards him, as well as generous towards him and the rest of the cast and crew. Reggie also said that he counts himself as lucky to have been able to work with the chat show host.</p><p>However, this attitude towards James doesn't seem like the same experience that others who have worked with him can agree with. It appears that even in his earlier days when he was rising to fame but was still only known in the UK that some who worked with him had to have a word with him about his behavior.</p><p>James co-created and starred in a sitcom in the UK called Gavin and Stacey between 2007 and 2010 and this is possibly <a href=#>where his 'diva' behavior started and caused fans to start turning against him</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>20 Surprising Facts About James Corden Pre-Fame</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One person who starred alongside James in the hit sitcom was actor Rob Brydon, who allegedly had to talk to James about his behavior on-set (and possibly off-set, too) as it seemed that the success of the show had all got to James' head.</p><p>Despite this, it does at least appear that James was aware of this behavior as he admitted to having acted like this during one interview and even led him to <a href=#>seek help for dealing with his newfound fame</a> and whilst this doesn't seem to have done much for his dealings with the public, he at least seems to have his behavior under control whilst working.</p><h2 id=what-do-celebrities-think-of-james-corden>What Do Celebrities Think Of James Corden?</h2><p>Judging from the opinions of members of the public who have had dealings with him and those who have worked with him, it seems like James has a very love-hate personality, and it appears as though this carries over to celebs who have had experiences with him.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>You'll Never Guess James Corden's Net Worth As He Exits 'Late Late Show'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are a number of different <a href=#>celebrities who hate James</a>, including Ricky Gervais, Patrick Stewart, Halle Berry, and Britney Spears. From James not listening to their requests, coming across as not wanting to be doing the work he's doing and for whatever reason just not liking him, there doesn't seem to be a lot of love for James from any of them.</p><p>However, there are also many celebs who seem to love James. For example, it is widely publicized that <a href=#>Harry Styles has a great friendship with James</a>. He also seems to be quite close with Adele as she <a href=#>wrote a song for him during his final carpool karaoke segment</a> (and appeared on two separate occasions).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/james-corden-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Looking at all the evidence, it seems that there is no exact answer as to what James is really like but given all the negativity surrounding him, it may be best if he cleans up his act and treats everyone in a nice and equal manner.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecmapJ6rXZi8s7DEp2SrnZGhubp5y6Kinmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
