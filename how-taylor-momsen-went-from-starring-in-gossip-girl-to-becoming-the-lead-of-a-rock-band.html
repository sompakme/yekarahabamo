Despite acting since she was two years old, this was Momsen’s breakout role and even earned her a Saturn Award nomination.</p><p>Despite the success of How the Grinch Stole Christmas, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the young actress was bullied at school for her role in this film.</a></p><p>“The Grinch changed my life in a multitude of ways — one of them being I was made fun of relentlessly,” Momsen revealed during an interview on Podcrushed, a podcast series co-hosted by her former Gossip Girl co-star <a href=# rel=nofollow>Penn Badgley</a>. “Every time I would start a new school or go somewhere else, I don’t even think the kids knew my name.

Being the youngest person on the cast wasn’t easy for her. It also didn’t help that she had to leave friends behind, after finally finding her "little groove in [middle] school as a normal kid,” to film the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with Penn Badgley, the actress-turned-musician revealed that she felt like she never felt like she fit in with the rest of her co-stars due to her age.</p><p>“I was so much younger than all of you," she admitted, noting that Connor Paolo was the closest in age to her, though he is three years her senior. "He was actually great, when I moved to New York, Connor and I became friends, and he took me under his wing."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Cast Of Gossip Girl Almost Looked Very Different, Here Are The Actors Who Almost Played The OG Characters</a></span></p><p>"I didn't have my own clique. I didn’t fit in with you guys,” Momsen told Badgley. “I didn’t fit in with Connor [Paolo]’s friends — I was younger than them. I was the new girl. I was Grinch Girl. I was always in this kind of weird, isolated world — partially of my own creating, probably.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ultimately, Momsen’s isolation from the rest of the Gossip Girl cast turned out to be a good thing because it allowed her to explore other ventures, such as music. "That's where music became such a solace for me. It was this place where I could just be, writing songs and emoting how I felt because I was by myself a lot," she admitted.</p><h2 id=taylor-momsen-admitted-that-quitting-acting-to-pursue-a-music-career-was-an-easy-choice>Taylor Momsen Admitted That Quitting Acting To Pursue A Music Career Was An Easy Choice</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar50556595.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor Momsen felt a pull to music</a> from a very young age. On one occasion, she admitted that "music is where I can be me," she told Digital Spy in 2010.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I really do it because I love it, honestly. It's what I want to do with my life. I mean, it's my only goal.” She also explained that, to her, music is very different from acting because it’s far more personal, and “you're involved in every step of it." But Momsen has been acting for even longer than she’s been making music. So, how did she decide to quit Gossip Girl to become a rockstar?</p><p>Momsen formed her band, The Pretty Reckless, with the help of rock music producer Kato Khandwala in 2009. After several successful gigs, the band signed with Interscope Records and released their debut album in 2010. Suddenly, Momsen realized she enjoyed making music way more than acting.</p><p>“I started modeling at 2, and then acting at 3, and then Gossip Girl when I was 12, so I wasn’t really making my own decisions,” <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Momsen told the Daily Beast</a> in 2014. “When I got to a place where I realized I was in control of my own life, and had found the right band, and everything was coming to fruition, it wasn’t even a question: I was going to quit my day job.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Luckily, the Gossip Girl producers supported her decision and wrote her off the show so she could pursue her true passion.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbaledOasKWnomK6sLnSnqVmn59is7O7zGaqrZmip7avs4yipWafn6jAqryMoKCrpF2pvG6uxJympqGenHq1tMRmraibkaG2tMCMqJ1mmV2nvKS3jJuYp5xf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
