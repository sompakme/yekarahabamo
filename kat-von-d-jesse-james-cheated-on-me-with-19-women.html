Ink star and tattoo artist, 29, and the motorcycle mogul, 43, called it quits for good in September after a nixed engagement and a brief reconciliation.</p><p>In a Facebook blog post on Sunday, Von D (real name: Katherine von Drachenberg) admitted that James cheated epically on her as well.</p><p>“Today I encountered the 19th girl to add to the list of people Jesse cheated on me with during this last year,” she wrote in the post, entitled “Thank You, Jesse James.”</p><p>“I kept going back and forth in my mind as to what the best way would be for me to release and let go of any residual feelings remaining from that toxic relationship,” Von D added. ” All of this may sound petty or immature to some, but I assure you this is coming from a place of pure honesty and love.”</p><p>James and Bullock’s nearly six year marriage imploded in spring 2010 when his affair with tattooed stripper (and a Von D doppelganger) <strong>Michelle McGee </strong>was revealed; McGee was just one of many women who came forward about flings with the Monster Garage star.</p><p>Von D admits in her post that she thought James was vilified and unfairly depicted in the media.</p><p>“There was a time when I was confident and excited at proving the world wrong, because I believed so deeply in people’s ability to change for the better,” she writes.</p><p>“Although this was not a primary purpose in the relationship, I did feel like it would be a positive thing for those who judged Jesse solely based on what they read in tabloids, to see that change is always possible — even in the people who seem hopeless,” she admits.</p><p>But the post isn’t about revenge against her ex, she insists.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I tried my best to go through all of this without venting, or complaining, or fueling more tabloid mumbo jumbo — but this isn’t about any of that… This is about me making peace with myself, and forgiving myself for making some bad mistakes.”</p><p>And she knows what all her fans and detractors are thinking. “I deserve a big fat ‘I told you so,’ from everyone, and wish I didn’t have to say, ‘You all were more right than you’ll ever know’ but you were,” she concedes. “Not to worry, I’ve gladly paid the consequences for every mistake I’ve ever made, but learned so much from each of them.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmaRiw7C6jJ1ko52jqLJutsCmnKxlk52yosDEnWSopl2ism7DyK2fZmlpYsSwucSnZGtoYWZ%2BdX2QaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
