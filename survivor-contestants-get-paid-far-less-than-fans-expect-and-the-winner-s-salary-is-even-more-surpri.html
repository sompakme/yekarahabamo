For example, most fans don't know <a href=#>the first player who was medically evacuated</a> went to jail, that <a href=#>celebrities affect the game</a>, and that <a href=#>the show uses body doubles</a>.</p><p>On the other hand, it seems like even <a href=#>new fans who are trying to figure out which seasons to watch first</a> know that the winner gets $1 million. However, the truth about how much money Survivor winners and other players get paid to compete is more complicated than that.</p><p>This article will reveal how <strong>much money the people who compete on Survivor actually get paid</strong>. Then, this article will look at <strong>how much more the $1 million prize was worth during the early seasons than it is in the 2020s</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=survivor-winners-and-players-don-39-t-get-paid-as-much-as-most-fans-think>Survivor Winners And Players Don't Get Paid As Much As Most Fans Think</h2><p>In the years since the first season of Survivor aired, certain aspects of competing on the show have become a lot more valuable. For example, more and more players have become more concerned about being able to call themselves the Sole Survivor than about the money.</p><p>On top of that, many modern players speak at length about how they are Survivor "superfans". For many of those players, just being able to go on the show, try the challenges, and interact with Jeff Probst is the main prize they are after.</p><p>As it turns out, it is a really good thing that many Survivor players see value in the game outside of the prize money. The reason for that is the truth that <strong>Survivor players and even the winners get paid a lot less than many fans think</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/your-paragraph-text-2024-06-24t105152-622.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In May 2018, Survivor fans got a window into how much the show's stars get paid to appear. That came when an infamous player spoke out about <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how financially rewarding competing on Survivor is</a></strong>.</p><p>At that time, Fortune reported on a conversation that Jon "Jonny Fairplay" Dalton had with TMZ. While Jonny Fairplay has been duplicitous, his comments are credible in this case because they are in line with other reporting.</p><p>Clearly, Jonny Fairplay believed that starring in a season of Survivor was rewarding enough. While talking to Inside Survivor in October 2017, Fairplay revealed he was open to playing again. "If invited… depends on the theme... I’m interested in a Legends season, I’d like to prove to the other Survivors, the fans and myself that I’m the best of the best."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/the-least-deserving-and-worst-survivor-winners-of-all-time-according-to-fans.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The Least Deserving And Worst Survivor Winners Of All Time, According To Fans">The Least Deserving And Worst Survivor Winners Of All Time, According To Fans</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Some Survivor winners didn't deserve to prevail according to the show's biggest fans.</p><p>As Fairplay explained to TMZ, <strong>the first player eliminated during each season would receive $3,500</strong>. From there, Fairplay spoke about how much money players who serve on the jury get paid for their efforts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Fairplay, <strong>making it far enough to vote on who would win will get a player paid $40,000</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/9E9282CF-DCFE-4BF2-B43B-606F09E2AADB.jpeg><p>Of course, the most interesting question is how much the final three Survivor players get paid. Fortunately, Fairplay revealed what those figures are during seasons that have three players during the final tribal council.</p><p>According to Fairplay, <strong>the two runners-up from each season receive $110,000</strong>.</p><p>While most people believe that Survivor winners get $1 million, Fairplay told TMZ that <strong>winners actually get paid $1,010.000</strong>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tt_survivor-s-sunday-burquest-suffered-a-debilitating-health-issue-on-the-show-before-she-died-tragically_061824_2160x1080px.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Survivor's Sunday Burquest Suffered A Debilitating Health Issue On The Show Before She Died Tragically">Survivor's Sunday Burquest Suffered A Debilitating Health Issue On The Show Before She Died Tragically</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Survivor's Sunday Burquest time on the show made her suffer a terrifying medical emergency before she later died tragically.</p><p>The reason winners got paid a little bit more than fans think is fascinating and simple. <strong>Survivor players got paid $10,000 to appear during the reunion</strong>. However, since Survivor has adopted the aftershow instead of the reunion, it is unclear if players still get that money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the 40th season, Survivor: Winners at War players received more money. According to an Entertainment Weekly article, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">every cast member for that season received at least $35,000</a> . The season's winner got a $2 million prize with a possible reunion bonus.</p><p>If the reunion fee no longer gets paid, winners get $1 million, runners-up get $100,000, and jurors get $30,000. The first player out still gets $3,500 with the possibility of a $10,000 bonus if the reunion salary is still in effect.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/survivor-s-richard-hatch-looking-shocked.jpg><p>Sadly, it has to be noted that winners don't take home $1 million and runners-up don't get $100,000. Instead, <strong>players have to pay a huge chunk of their winnings in taxes</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Richard Hatch is a cautionary tale about that since <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he spent time in prison because taxes weren't paid on his Survivor winnings</a></strong>. Hatch has always maintained that he was told that CBS would pay the taxes, but a court of law found him responsible and he was sentenced to more than four years in prison.</p><p>On the bright side for Survivor players that get eliminated before the jury, they also get an all-expenses-paid vacation.</p><h2 id=survivor-winners-now-get-paid-a-lot-less-money-than-the-early-winners>Survivor Winners Now Get Paid A Lot Less Money Than The Early Winners</h2><p>From the very start, every Survivor player has competed to win $1 million and the title of sole Survivor.
