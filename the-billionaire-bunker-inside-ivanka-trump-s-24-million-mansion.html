After Trump was elected into office, Ivanka and her husband Jared were appointed as Senior Advisors to the President during the Trump Administration. <a href=#>Ivanka’s ventures and advisor job has amassed her a $300 million</a> net worth, making her one of the richest people in her family. Kushner, the heir to a real estate developer, has an $800 million fortune, so the couple collectively is a billionaire. After the two received negative media attention for their involvement with the administration, they moved to Florida <a href=#>with their three kids</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple purchased two back-to-back properties in April 2021 on the exclusive Indian Creek Island, one of them being a $24 million home with a stunning waterfront view. Let’s take a look at Ivanka’s $24 million Florida Mansion.</p><h2 id=the-island-of-the-rich-and-famous>The Island Of The Rich And Famous</h2><p>The Indian Creek Island features <a href=#>some of the most exclusive properties</a> in Florida for the uber-rich. The home purchased by the couple has been on the market since October 2020. As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NY Post</a>, the home's previous owners were billionaire business professional Alex Murerelo and his wife Lisa, and they put the house on sale for $24.9 million. However, the price was later brought down to $24 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>A Golden Flight: Inside Donald Trump's $100 Million Gold Plated Private Jet</a></span></p><p>Constructed in 1994, the home is set on 1.24 acres of land and 8,510 sq. ft. of interior space. It is equipped with six bedrooms, eight bathrooms, and one partial bathroom. The first aerial shots of the space reflected that the home would require a few refurbishments as the photos emerged of broken tiles and algae-covered swimming pools.</p><h2 id=a-luxurious-residence>A Luxurious&nbsp;Residence</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As soon as the entrance opens, the eyes are drawn to the sweeping double staircase known as the Cinderella staircase. The luxurious look of the foyer is enhanced by every aspect of the area, such as the eye-catchy magnificent crystal chandelier hanging from 26-foot ceilings, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Luxury Launches</a>. The doorway from the foyer leads to the Living Room that views a very scenic garden. The Living Room has a wet bar, TV, and shelving space. Rooms are decorated in the hues of cream and blue.</p><p><a href=#>The front of the home</a> has a beautiful reflecting pool that reportedly costs $15,000 to $30,000 for installment, and the in-ground hot tub is also located next to the pool, which costs about $25,000. The mansion also has a large gym, a formal dining room, a screening room, wood-paneled workspaces, and a deck.</p><p>The most stunning room in the Billionaire Bunker is the Master Bedroom. It has a gigantic area, marble bathrooms, separate sinks, and a bathtub. The room features two walk-in closets and vanity rooms with gorgeous views of the outdoors for the couple to get ready for their day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The area of Indian Creek has a few exclusive amenities for its residents. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Richest</a>, there is a 24-hour police force that looks after the residents. One officer looks after three residents. As the island is equipped with a single bridge, the security is airtight to protect the property owners, including a marine patrol. The island also has an 18-hole golf course and a restaurant. The couple was asked not to apply for the Country Club Membership in January 2021 after the residents refused to nominate their names to become a part of the community.</p><h2 id=more-interesting-purchases-on-the-island>More Interesting Purchases On The Island</h2><p><a href=#>The second property bought by Ivanka</a> and Kushner was on Indian Creek Island in December 2020. The two purchased a property for $32.2 million from legendary Spanish singer Julio Iglesias, who had listed the mansion on sale in 2016.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The empty lot spans across 1.84 acres and comes with a vast 200 ft. of private waterfront. They bought the land to build a more significant estate for themselves, and the construction would take two years.</p><p>The Billionaire Bunker is an expensive property that will tax the pair $472,746 annually. Trump and Kushner can also expect to spot some of their famous neighbors on a casual morning jog. Legendary NFL player who plays for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, <a href=#>Tom Brady</a> and his wife Gisele Bündchen, recently bought a property for $17 million in December 2020.</p><p>Amongst the land of the rich and famous, Ivanka and Jared fit right in with the $24 million mansions and the adjoining property they purchased in 2020. As the construction for their home is still in progress, they are currently renting a luxury condo in Surfside, Florida, with their three children.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Inside Antilia: The World's Most Expensive Private Residence</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NY Post</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Luxury Launches</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Richest</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMm6ClpJmku6K10Z5km62eoLKzecinqqKclWK2t63NpJhmrKKqurG%2FjGtrZqWZobmqu81mpJqmo568r3s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
