I’ve loved every minute of making this movie,” he captioned <a href=# rel=noopener>the Instagram post</a>. “Well… not the 4a training or the steamed fish and veg 4 x a day for 6 months but the other 93.2%.”</p><p>After portraying Wolverine in eight films, Jackman announced he had retired the mutant character after starring in Logan in 2017. He later reversed that decision to return for Deadpool 3 and was happy to work with costar <a href=#><strong>Ryan Reynolds</strong></a> as well as director <strong>Shawn Levy</strong>.</p><p>“To two of my best mates @vancityreynolds and @slevydirect I literally couldn’t have done this without you,” he wrote. “LITERALLY! July 26th can’t come soon enough. Time to shave.”</p><p>Filming on Deadpool 3 resumed last month after production was halted last summer due to the SAG-AFTRA strike, which ended in November 2023.</p><p>Reynolds, 47, who is also a cowriter and coproducer of the film, also celebrated the end of filming via social media on Wednesday.</p><p>“The suit hides blood. Also sweat… But today, with Deadpool wrapping, it’s mostly tears,” Reynolds <a href=# rel=noopener>captioned an Instagram photo</a> of his costumed crotch. “A giant and forever thanks to the cast and crew of our film who battled wind, rain, strikes and @thehughjackman… all under the stalwart leadership of @slevydirect. I got to make a movie with my closest pals and that doesn’t happen very often. See ya July 26th…”</p><p>Deadpool 3 reunites Reynolds and Jackman in their Marvel roles for the first time since 2009’s X-Men Origins: Wolverine.</p><p>After previously announcing he would never appear as Wolverine again, Jackman explained what inspired his change of mind during a December 2022 appearance on SiriusXM’s <a href=# rel=noopener>The Jess Cagle Show.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Hugh-Jackman-Shaves-Wolverine-Beard-to-Celebrate-Deadpool-3-Wrapping-Production-What-a-Ride-157.jpg><p>“I’d announced Logan was my last, and then I went to see the Deadpool movie and I was 20 minutes in. I was like, ‘Christmas.’ First of all, I loved the movie, but all I could see was <strong>Nick Nolte</strong>, <strong>Eddie Murphy</strong> in 48 Hours,” he recalled. “I was like, ‘This is something I haven’t done, we haven’t done, with the character. That’s the kind of dynamic we haven’t had before.’ But then I just put it aside.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>When Jackman decided he wanted to portray Wolverine in Deadpool 3, he immediately called Reynolds.</p><p>“It just came to me like that. I rang Ryan as soon as I arrived and he was floored,” Jackman recalled. “Interestingly, he was just about to have a meeting with <strong>Kevin Feige</strong> at Marvel at 5 o’clock that afternoon about the Deadpool movie. And so he goes, ‘This is really good timing, but are you really sure? Cause I don’t wanna say anything.’ I said, ‘I’m 100 percent sure.’ And I dunno why, because I was 100 percent sure I was out before. And then all of a sudden I was 100 percent in.”</p><p>The original Deadpool was the ninth-highest-grossing film of 2016 with $783 million in box office receipts worldwide. Deadpool 2 in 2018 matched its success, grossing $786 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ%2Bun5hit6KvyqaYp2Wjna63sdJmrqikppq%2FqrrEZpmemaKZerW7jJycpZ2Sp661sYydnJqcoKS8rXmSZq6rmaBk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
