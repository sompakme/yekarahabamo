I think I was, like, maybe about five weeks out when we started filming, which I think that’s pretty brave,” Jennifer told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly’s</i>&nbsp;<a href=#>“Getting Real with the Housewives”</a> podcast on Wednesday, February 2. “I watched the episode, I mean, I had the same exact critiques at the time of myself, which is one of the reasons why I wanted to be so vocal about my nose job, because it was such a shock. I kind of look whack in that first episode, but, like, as you can see, it’s settling in real nice and I’m really happy with it now. I didn’t take it personally.”</p><p class=p1>During the&nbsp;<i>RHONJ&nbsp;</i>premiere, the reality star revealed she got the procedure done while visiting family in Turkey in 2021. She found her doctor “on Instagram,” since her plastic surgeon husband, <strong>Bill Aydin</strong>, refused to do any more procedures on her since she is the “worst patient in the world.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Jennifer-Aydin-Expected-RHONJ-Costars-Slam-Her-Nose-Job-001.jpg><p class=p1>“I just wanted it to look like how I looked in filters, which is, I think what everybody’s ultimate goal is,” Jennifer explained to&nbsp;<i>Us.</i>&nbsp;“I think it was also very interesting because I did speak about how unhappy I was … but the goal for plastic surgery is always to look better. You know, it’s not to look worse.”</p><p class=p1>The Bravo star admitted that she is “not that happy” with her chin following her procedure and “may take it out.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“I’m not sure, I have to wait a year, you know, all types of plastic surgery, you should wait a year before any type of revision,” Jennifer told&nbsp;<i>Us.</i>&nbsp;“But trust and believe I will be honest about it if I ever do anything.”</p><p class=p1><i>The Real Housewives of New Jersey&nbsp;</i>airs on Bravo Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmqaeUmK60wNJonp6spJ67qHnRnpilZaeewal506GcZqCfqsCmw8ivnKxnmpq7r7XFnqlmmamZtq95xLGnnpukmrFuvseopaNlk6TAta3RrGStp12ouaK5jKGcq2WepMCmecmomWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
