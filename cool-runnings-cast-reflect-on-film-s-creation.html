According to the platform, the movie went through heavy-handed changes and corporate critique the actors endured to tell the empowering story.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Before <a href=#>Disney took over</a> and made it a family film, there were drugs, racism and the characters were getting laid a lot,” reflected Rawle D. Lewis, who starred as Junior Bevil. “I saw it morph into the movie that it is now. It was something that had never been told before – Jamaicans in tights? People were like, ‘How’s this going to go under the Disney umbrella?’”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The movie’s producer, Dawn Steel, reportedly disappeared for eight months before returning with a new script, and the title Cool Runnings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MSDCORU_BV005.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Director Jon Turteltaub discussed speaking with Lewis and the three other leading men, Malik Yoba, Doug E. Doug, and Leon, about their accents in the film and the notes dished out from <a href=#>Disney’s then-boss </a>and Dreamworks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“The next day, I told the cast, ‘I’m going to get fired if you don’t sound like Sebastian the Crab. Please don’t get me fired,’”&nbsp;shared Turteltab, reminiscing on a tense phone conversation with Katzenberg.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“They wanted me to sound like a Black Aladdin,” remembered Leon. “They wanted a Disney version. It was tough because if anybody wants to be authentic, it’s me —&nbsp;but I’m a professional and I had to do the job.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Yoba added “They’d say, ‘People in Middle America won’t be able to understand you.’ At that time, people had less access to cultural differences and didn’t know how <a href=#>Jamaican[s] really sounded.</a>”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MSDCORU_BV001.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Cool Runnings went on to inspire viewers from different walks of life.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">A lot of people think I was in prison with them,” shared Lewis. “They tell me [the guards] let them watch it because it’s not too violent. I like that we’re the safe choice in prisons.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“So many people have shared stories with us about how&nbsp;Cool Runnings&nbsp;has changed their lives,” Leon added. “I’ll never forget the 12-year-old boy who lost his dad and was so depressed that he watched the movie for 30 days straight to make himself feel better. I don’t take it for granted.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5i8sLiMq6ynppmjtLR5wpqqrWWimrOtscKtZJ%2BhnKJ6cn6SbW5ycGhmhXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
