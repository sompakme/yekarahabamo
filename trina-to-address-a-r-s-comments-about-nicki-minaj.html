Second of all, everything that I have to say, I will address it tomorrow. So catch me live and I will say it one time and one time only. I will not repeat myself.”</p><p>During her Queen Radio session on Monday (Aug. 13), Nicki addressed Saunders and said she was prepared to shoot a video to “BAPS” when the song was recorded in 2017. She also had Trina as a guest for Queen Radio at the time of the song’s release, making it the most-streamed track on the project.</p><p>“I have my own schedule and I also have to worry about what makes not only sense/cents but dollars,” she said. “And it’s not fair that people don’t understand that. I would never have someone from my team disrespect somebody that has been nothing but real to me.”</p><p>You can listen to “BAPS” below.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6m%2FqrrAZquoZZGZsbOx0qxkmqqjYrCwucyepa2rXZavsMHTZqWim5ueeq61zZqhZqeeYravv9OanquZnWK5qsLEZm1vaGZtfnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
