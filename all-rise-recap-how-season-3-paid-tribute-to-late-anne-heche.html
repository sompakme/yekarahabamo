Corinne, true to form, was her usual self as she ruthlessly defended her client in Judge Lola Carmichael’s (<strong>Simone Missick</strong>) courtroom. While Corinne’s client was ultimately convicted, it was not shown how she reacted.</p><p class=p1>In the pivotal final scene, Lola realized that the seemingly random postcards she had received earlier actually matched up where the defendant <a href=#>buried his victims</a>. The final note hinted that he was allegedly planning something new in Lola’s backyard before the screen cut to black.</p><p class=p1>Saturday’s <i>All Rise </i>episode did not further reveal how or if they plan to write out Heche’s character following <a href=#>the actress’ death</a>. Production did add a <a href=#>meaningful dedication</a> before the credits rolled. (Heche was also the final guest star listed in the title sequence, given “and” status.)</p><p class=p1>“<a href=#>In memory of Anne Heche</a>,” the title card read. “Our friend and wonderful artist. You are missed.”</p><p class=p1><i>Us Weekly</i> confirmed in August 2022 that <a href=#>Heche had died at the age of 53</a>. The late actress had been comatose after her involvement <a href=#>in a fiery car crash</a>. Heche is <a href=#>survived by her two sons</a>, Homer and Atlas. (She shared Homer with ex-husband<a href=#><strong> Coley Laffoon</strong></a> and Atlas with former partner<a href=#><strong> James Tupper</strong></a>).</p><p class=p1>“My brother Atlas and I lost our Mom. After six days of almost unbelievable emotional swings, I am left with a deep, wordless sadness,” Homer, 20,&nbsp;<a href=#>wrote in a statement at the time</a>. “Hopefully my mom is free from pain and beginning to explore what I like to imagine as her eternal freedom. Over those six days, thousands of friends, family, and fans made their hearts known to me. I am grateful for their love, as I am for the support of my Dad, Coley, and my stepmom Alexi who continue to be my rock during this time.”</p><p class=p1>Atlas, 14, <a href=#>broke his silence earlier this year</a>. “My mom was the brightest person I’ve ever known,” he told the&nbsp;<i>Los Angeles Inquisitor</i>&nbsp;in January. “She always knew how to solve a problem, or help a friend. She always knew the right thing to do. I cannot put into words how grateful I am or how much I miss her.”</p><p class=p1>A <a href=#>memorial for Heche was held in May</a>, on Mother’s Day, at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“Anne was given her final resting place Sunday [May 14] afternoon at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery – Cathedral Mausoleum,” a rep for the late actress told <i>Us </i>in a statement of the “lovely ceremony” <a href=#>in her memory</a>. “She loved everyone so passionately and deeply and her children, her legacy, thank everyone for their support and love through this difficult time and are grateful to be able to honor their mother on Mother’s Day.”</p><p class=p1><i>All Rise </i>airs on OWN Saturdays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJilpF2ntrSxjKucnJmgYrWww4ysnJqrn6N6dHnPmqCdZaSntqPB055kraddoa61sYyapaedXZ2ypLTEaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
