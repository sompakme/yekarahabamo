First, West was spotted out with Irina Shayk, but the jury's still out on whether that was anything serious. Then Ye paired up with model-influencer Vinetria in November 2021. That, too, fizzled out, and fans thought Ye might be recharging his campaign for Kim to take him back. <a href=../../../../who-was-julia-fox-before-she-made-headlines-as-kanye-west-s-girlfriend.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../../../flavor-flav-opens-chicken-joint-stereotypical-ad-sets-black-america-back.html>Flavor Flav Opens Chicken Joint, Stereotypical Ad Sets Black America Back</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>
