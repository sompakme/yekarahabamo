In February, the couple <a href=#>sparked split speculation</a> after a dramatic weekend ahead of <a href=#>Super Bowl LVII</a>. The <a href=#>New Girl</a> alum and the Houston native attended a party together two days before the big game, but Fox flew home before Kelly’s scheduled performance the following evening.</p><p>“Megan and MGK had a big fight in Arizona,” an insider exclusively told Us Weekly at the time. “She was supposed to go to his performance at the Sports Illustrated party, but they had a fight and she canceled plans and flew out Saturday evening.”</p><p>The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles star later raised eyebrows when she shared a since-deleted Instagram post that included a line from <a href=#><strong>Beyoncé</strong></a>‘s 2016 album, Lemonade: “You can taste the dishonesty / It’s all over your breath.”</p><p>Days later, Fox <a href=#>denied rumors that Kelly had cheated</a> on her with guitarist <a href=#><strong>Sophie Lloyd</strong></a>. “There has been no third party interference in this relationship of any kind,” she wrote via Instagram in February. “That includes, but is not limited to … actual humans, DMs, AI bots or succubus demons.”</p><p>In March, an insider exclusively told Us that the duo were <a href=#>“currently on a break”</a> but still keeping in touch. “They have stalled wedding planning to work on their issues,” the source explained. “Their relationship is pretty volatile at the moment. They are currently off, but still texting each other.”</p><p>One month later, however, the twosome were <a href=#>spotted holding hands</a> during a romantic <a href=#>getaway to Hawaii</a>. Shortly after the photos made headlines, a source told Us that Fox and Kelly were still <a href=#>trying to work things out</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Colson knew it was going to take a lot of growth and healing to make things really work with Megan,” the insider said. “But he knows she’s worth everything and more, so he would go to the ends of the earth to repair their relationship no matter what it took.”</p><p>Before her romance with the “Rap Devil” musician, Fox was married to <a href=#><strong>Brian Austin Green</strong></a>. The former couple share children Noah, 10, Bodhi, 9, and Journey, 6. Kelly, for his part, shares daughter Casie, 13, with <strong>Emma Cannon</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamnZeWu26yzrFkpqGjqLavs4yfqailXaKupLTIp5xmn6Wjeqyxy6WwZppdma66ec%2Baqa2xXaW1sMDOrGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
