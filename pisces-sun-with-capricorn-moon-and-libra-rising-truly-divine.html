Do you find yourself romantically pulled towards many people and different experiences, but then you feel the call of personal ambition which keeps you on the straight and even, devoted to family and those you can trust? Does the mystery of life and human love move you to fulfill personal responsibilities and then go on to serve in the wider world?</p><p>With a Pisces Sun Capricorn Moon, you are a blend of gentle compassion and stoicism, of tenderness and taciturnity, of romance and work ethic. Sometimes you are yielding, sometimes in-&nbsp;flexible. Your quiet demeanor and reserve can be deceptive, for you have tremendous strength, initiative and self-respect which helps you get where you want to be.</p><p>Your sensitivity to the outer world and the people that fill it is acute; and de- pending on your particular interests, you will use your perceptions – about people’s aims, needs, strengths and weaknesses – to achieve your goals and gain the recognition and respect you desire. In other words, you may be a successful business person, an enigmatic actor, a self-contained artist or an enthusiastic volunteer worker for the Salvation Army. In whatever role you choose, you use both imagination and logic, both feeling and shrewd calculation in creating the right scenario and asserting your gentle control.</p><p>Genuinely sympathetic and emotionally generous, you nevertheless possess an astute awareness of life’s stark realities. Although your Piscean side wavers and is hesitant about taking on too much responsibility, your Capricorn side is fairly ambitious and really comes alive when you are getting your teeth into a challenging project. Hard times do not frighten you; in fact, they bring out both the romance and hardiness of your combination. Your values are of the intangible realm – love, relationship, respect, a sense of community – but you back them up with muscle power, and often real sweat and tears. Whatever it might be, you are willing to work with commitment to achieve your dream.&nbsp;</p><p>On the one hand you are a very matter-of-fact, practical person, and on the&nbsp;other a dreamy, tender-hearted romantic. Socially you can mix with a wide spectrum of people. You have a sense of the fragility and tragedy of life and can connect with others by feeling their plight. You feel for the underprivileged and those who suffer, but you prefer to show your compassion in a pragmatic way, helping others&nbsp;to help themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>With a Pisces Sun Capricorn Moon, you have a strong sense of yourself and can stick to your larger long-term purposes, but because you flow with what needs doing you make an excellent organizer and manager, able to harness the moods and energies of those around you&nbsp;productively. You are expressive in subtle but powerful ways and can be something&nbsp;of a practical visionary who is able to translate your own and other people’s plans into achievable realities.&nbsp;</p><h3>Keywords For A Pisces Sun Capricorn Moon:</h3><p>Humane; helpful; charitable; serious and self-reflective; perceptive; cautious; discreetly ambitious; circumspect; pillar of strength; fount of compassion; philosophical humor; moral integrity; strategic; devoted; a reserved romantic; dutiful; deep sense of justice; dependable; pinning down the elusive.&nbsp;</p><h2>Libra Rising</h2><p>If you have Libra Rising, you have natural charm, grace, and poise. You are extremely social-minded and take pleasure in being with other people in a cheerful atmosphere. Parties, holidays, laughter, fun, and good times are what Libra Rising individuals revel in. You have a happy and easygoing personality and are full of hope for the future. No matter what disappointments today may bring, Libra Rising individuals fantasize about happy tomorrows and look forward to living them.</p><p>Of course, you are not this way all the time. With Libra Rising, one of your problems is that you are easily thrown into despair and depression, especially by downhearted and discouraging people. Libra is the sign of balance, but it doesn’t take much to push Libra Rising individuals off balance. Basically, however, your spirits are optimistic and carefree.</p><p>As an individual with Libra Rising, you are born with a great sense of fairness, and nothing angers you more than to see injustice go uncorrected. You are deeply upset by cruelty, violence, bloodshed, and strife. To you, life should be serene and content, but it must, above all, be fair.</p><p>Libra Rising individuals are refined, neat, and discriminating. You breathe rarefied air. Your aloof quality is sometimes hard for others to figure out, but it will never leave you even though you function so well with other people.</p><p>With Libra Rising, you gravitate toward artistic and creative endeavors, but sometimes your artistic flair lies dormant and unused, for you dislike hard work and prefer to take the easy way out. You don’t have to seek the spotlight, however; it shines on you. You don’t struggle to find success; luck often comes to Libra Rising individuals through a partner, mate, or close association.</p><p>Having Libra Rising, you like travel, new people, new projects. You happily throw yourself into enterprises that promise excitement or diversion. The trouble is you don’t have much perseverance, so a great many things go unfinished. Another difficulty you have is making up your mind. You weigh a decision carefully, vacillating between one course of action and another; when you’ve finally decided you still hesitate. There is a timidity behind all this pondering, a fear of taking risks.</p><p>Libra Rising individuals are unhappy when single and are fond of being married. (This does not necessarily mean that you will stay married to the same person.) Somewhere along the way Libra Rising individuals are likely to gain wealth and material possessions through a marriage partner. As a rule, you don’t have a lot of children, but you take great delight in those you do have.</p><p>As a Libra Rising individual, you tend to have a strikingly good-looking face, graceful and symmetrical bone structure, and a radiant smile. Your body is usually curving or round, though not necessarily fat.</p><p>The planet Venus, which rules Libra, is very prominent in your birth chart. The influence of Venus bestows beauty, charm, social graces, a romantic nature, an appreciation for art, music, and decoration. It also encourages superficiality, jealousy, laziness, dependence on others, and a weak will.</p><p>Uncover deeper insights into your personality, motivations, & desires with an <a href=#><span><strong>In-Depth Astrology & Numerology Natal Chart Analysis</strong></span></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tb7UpbCdoaaeu6Z6wqikaKulo3quu86nZqmho5iytHnSrqVmr5mptW6vwKmpopufp7tuuc6opWaZnpl6rbXBq5hmqpmotq%2Bz</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
