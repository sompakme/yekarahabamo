In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=#>Erik Columbia of Local SYR,&nbsp;</a>the tag team previewed the show, and The Blade noted that, even though they’re heels, he wouldn’t mind getting some cheers from his fellow New Yorkers.</p><p>“We’re&nbsp;typically bad guys but for this night,&nbsp;we’re&nbsp;close to our hometown, so there is a mix (of cheers),” said The Blade. “I like all that stuff. I always say,&nbsp;wrestling fans, they paid their money, they can cheer for whoever they want. It adds a fun aspect to it.”</p><p>This week’s episode of Dynamite will also be quite meaningful because it will offer AEW fans and wrestlers alike a chance to honor the memory of the late, great Jon Huber. Formerly known as AEW star Brodie Lee, Huber was a Rochester native who passed away last year. <a href=#>AEW</a> was univerally renowned for “The Brodie Lee Celebration of Life”, an emotional episode of Dynamite dedicated to Lee shortly after his passing. This show in Rochester will honor be held in honor of Lee, and The Butcher shared his thoughts on how every member of the roster will have some extra incentive to deliver for this very reason.</p><p><b>“</b>It’s&nbsp;going to be huge,” said The Butcher. “I’m&nbsp;still riding high from the tribute show. That tribute show is one of my favorite matches&nbsp;I’ve&nbsp;ever had, because of the severity of what it meant&nbsp;and what it was. And&nbsp;I think this match [on Wednesday] is going to be there too.</p><p>“No one has really talked about it, but everyone is going to go extra hard because that arena is filled with him.&nbsp;He’s&nbsp;going to&nbsp;be part of every single person in that place.”</p><p>It’s since been announced that The Butcher and The Blade will be part of a 16-man tag team match on Dynamite in honor of Brodie Lee.
