Her love for the orchestra was a natural springboard into the drama programs in high school. She attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City and according to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Coolidge planned on becoming a dramatic actress, frequently referencing <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Meryl Streep</a> as her inspiration.
