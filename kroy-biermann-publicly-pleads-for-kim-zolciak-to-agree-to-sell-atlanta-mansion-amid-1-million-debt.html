Bergstrom revealed to Us Weekly</a> that the former NFL star is putting pressure on his estranged wife to sell their Atlanta mansion ASAP given their financial situation.</p><p>The lawyer says the duo have over $1 million in debt, which can be significant reduced if they sell the family home.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: &nbsp;<a href=#>OnlyFans Tried To Convince Britney Spears To Sign-Up (& She Considered It)</a></span></p><p>Kroy, who initially filed for divorce from Kim in May and then again in August after a short reconciliation, <a href=#>petitioned for an urgent hearing last month</a> to expedite the sale of the residence.</p><p>His court filing reveals that the house had initially been slated for auction in March, as a result of foreclosure proceedings against the couple the previous month. Thankfully, the parents-of-six managed to avert the foreclosure and subsequently called off the auction.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They did so by coming an agreement with the financial institution Truist, which outlined that as long as the couple maintained a continuous record of making their monthly mortgage payments for three consecutive months, any outstanding balances would be moved to the end of the loan, effectively preventing any foreclosure proceedings.</p><p>Nonetheless, in the midst of persistent financial challenges, including a debt exceeding $1 million in overdue taxes, the former couple seems to be eager to expedite the sale of their Georgia estate.</p><p>“If the court orders it then the court can enforce the order. It is taking control out of the hands of the parties,” Kroy’s lawyer added to Us Weekly. “And this is exactly what needs to be done at this point.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although it appears Kroy and Kim haven’t come to an agreement about the Atlanta property, Kim responded to his filing last month by stating to TMZ the decision to sell the home was “mutual” and that she “told him what to do.”</p><p>The couple initially initiated divorce proceedings in May, bringing an end to their 12-year marriage, although they reconciled a few weeks later. In Kroy's initial filing, he argued that the breakdown of their marriage was largely due to Kim's alleged gambling problem.</p><p>One factor that might have played a role in their divorce was Kim's recent lawsuit. Both she and their eldest daughter, Brielle, 21, are <a href=#>facing lawsuits for unpaid credit card debt,</a> amounting to tens of thousands of dollars.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: &nbsp;<a href=#>Woody Allen Considers Retirement After Amassing $140 Million Fortune As Cancel Culture Exhausts Him</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmakqp%2BueqO1xKukmqaeYr22rsuimqWxXaW5pq3DrGSfp6JiuKq5jLOmpZuZlrhuwM5mmKCqlZp6tbuMrJylpF2Wwa2tza2YZqWRo8Cqu81mmKahlGJ%2BbrnIpaOip55isaau02g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
