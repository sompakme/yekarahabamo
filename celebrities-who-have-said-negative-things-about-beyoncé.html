She is as good at her craft as she is at minding her own business. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hardly does she ever conduct any interviews</a> or respond to criticism; she simply puts in the work. Her strong work ethic and untroublesome nature <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">have earned her 28 Grammy awards</a> and numerous accolades. She stays humble, stays working, and just as she said in the song "Formation," her best revenge is her paper.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Why Some Fans Say Beyonce Is Totally Overrated</a></span></p><p>Despite Beyonce’s silent nature, some celebrities just won’t keep her name off their radar, for reasons known to themselves. Whether it’s criticism of her work or simply insinuating that she’s not so good an artist, some celebrities have taken it a bit too far. Even when offering criticism, there’s a cordial way to do it, and these celebrities didn’t get the memo. In the recent past, this vitriol towards the queen of the hive has unfolded many a time, and we’re here to unearth some of those moments.</p><h2 id=wendy-williams><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Wendy Williams</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s always hard to know whether or not Wendy Williams is a fan of<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Beyonce</a>. In the rare times that she happens to praise Beyonce's work, she almost instantly always does the exact opposite within no time. When Beyonce was set to release her HBO Special Life is But a Dream, Wendy Williams was quick to say, " I am a Beyonce fan…You know Beyonce can’t talk. She sounds like she has a fifth-grade education.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Keri Hilson Says She Reconciled With Beyonce</a></span></p><h2 id=azealia-banks><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Azealia Banks</span></h2><p>Azealia Banks has a lot to say about everything and anything, except her own music that, apparently, isn’t doing too well. In 2016, following the release of Beyonce’s award-winning album, Lemonade, Banks was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">quick to respond to writer Ta-Nehisi Coates' praise of the singer's work</a>. “ Don’t think for a second that Beyonce was intelligent enough to come up with any of those ideas on her own.” She tweeted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is Why Beyonce Doesn't Reportedly Get Along With Keyshia Cole</a></span></p><h2 id=kid-rock><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Kid Rock</span></h2><p>Kid Rock found himself on the wrong side of the hive when he gave a distasteful Rolling Stone interview. He claimed to not understand why fans were obsessed with the ‘Pretty Hurts’ singer. “ Beyonce, to me, doesn’t have a f*** ‘Purple Rain’, but she is the biggest thing on earth…How can you be that big without at least one ‘Sweet Home Alabama’ or ‘Old Time Rock & Roll'?” Kid Rock said, much to the displeasure of the hive.</p><h2 id=keyshia-cole><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Keyshia Cole</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2013, when Beyonce released ‘Bow Down’, one of the people who weren’t pleased with her was fellow singer Keyshia Cole. In a series of tweets, Cole called Beyonce out. “ Can’t stand when people all self-righteous when it’s convenient it makes them good…First women need to stick together, the b*** better bow down.” Cole tweeted, alleging that Beyonce was being hypocritical.</p><h2 id=donald-trump><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Donald Trump</span></h2><p>Former POTUS Donald Trump is not in the good books of many celebrities, Beyonce included. In 2016, when he was running for office, he didn’t have most celebrities’ support, and, if his 2019 Minneapolis rally speech is anything to go by, didn’t need them. At the rally, Trump sent some words in the direction of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyonce, Jay-Z, and Bruce Springsteen, who rallied behind Hillary Clinton in 2016</a>. “ I didn’t need Beyonce and Jay-Z, I didn’t need little Bruce Springsteen," Trump said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=etta-james><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Etta James</span></h2><p>After the election of President Barrack Obama into office in 2008, America was faced with a new dawn, and what a better way to celebrate an incoming president than have the queen serenade him at his first dance. While Beyonce was a good choice, not everyone was pleased, especially the one whose song she sang. Performing at Paramount theatre in Seattle, James said, “…But I tell you that woman he had singing for him, singing my song…she’s going to get her a** whupped.”</p><h2 id=carlos-santana><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Carlos Santana</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the history of every negative comment said about Beyonce, perhaps Carlos Santana’s words reign supreme above all, and not in a good way. In an interview with the New Zealand Herald, Santana said, “ I think Adele won a Grammy because she can sing-sing. With all respect to our sister Beyonce, Beyonce is very beautiful to look at and it’s more like modeling kind of music…she’s not a singer-singer.”</p><h2 id=piers-morgan><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Piers Morgan</span></h2><p>When Beyonce released Lemonade in 2016, Azaelia Banks wasn’t the only celebrity who wasn’t pleased with her. In a Daily Mail article, Morgan criticized the ‘new’ Beyonce, referring to her as Militant. In a tweet sharing the article, Morgan said, “ I feel uncomfortable about Beyonce using grieving mothers to sell albums. "Morgan, who’d previously interviewed Beyonce, called her old self “ Bright, warm, funny and sharp.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=khia><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Khia</span></h2><p>One-hit-wonder Khia, Just like Piers Morgan, had some things to get off her chest following the release of Beyonce’s Lemonade. This time, tennis legend Serena Williams also got on Khia’s bad side. “ First of all, the video was tired, and through, and long, and it made black people look bad as hell…B*** you walking around with this blonde long a** hair, but you want African kings and queens in your videos,” Khia said.</p><h2 id=kanye-west><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Kanye West</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's no secret that no love is lost between Kanye West and the Carters. The friends-turned-foes have been at it for years after Kanye and his former business partner Jay-Z fell apart. In a 2016 Sacramento concert, Kanye West went off mid-concert, “ I went down seven years of my life of m***** hating me for saying Beyonce had the best video…We are all great people, we are equal…but sometimes we be playing the politics too much and forgetting who we are.” Kanye ranted.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Hudson Once Apologized For Shade Thrown At Beyonce</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwMieqmavmKR6qa3VnmSsmZmZeq%2Bxxpqroq6VYsGptc2gqmaZkqTCtXnBnrCoppOafA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
