However, after the massive success this film achieved, he was paid an impressive $37 million dollars to appear in the sequel "Thor: The Dark World."&nbsp;</p><p>Hemsworth reportedly earned $30 million for 2017's "Thor: Ragnarok," but was also paid back-end points. Hemsworth has also played a key role in the Avengers films. His base salary for "Avengers: Infinity War" and "Avengers: Endgame" was $15 million plus a portion of the film's overall profits.</p><p>Aside from playing one of the most popular superheroes of all time, <a href=#>Hemsworth</a> also launched his health and fitness app in 2019 (via <a href=#>Mashable</a>). The star partners with world-renowned experts to craft a program that offers workouts, meditation-videos, and recipes that help each user achieve their fitness goals. A standard one-month subscription to the app costs $29.99 while a 12-month subscription is usually $359.88 dollars. The app currently has a 4.6 out of 5-star rating in the <a href=#>Apple App Store</a> based on over 6,000 reviews.</p><p>With this, per&nbsp;<a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Hemsworth is worth $130 million dollars as of 2021. However, that amount is sure to increase as he is currently slated to star in the upcoming fourth installment of the "Thor" franchise "Thor: Love and Thunder," "Furiosa," the prequel to "Mad Max: Fury Road," and a few other highly-anticipated projects (via <a href=#>IMDb</a>).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEpaCsrF6YvK57k2tucWtgZLCpvsisZKGdnajEsL7ToapmppWperi70a2fZqWRrnq0wdGpqaKrlWLGsMGO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
