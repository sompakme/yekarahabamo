After straightening her hair and driving to the hospital with Stocklin, 39, Ballinger found out that she had an umbilical cord complication and needed an emergency C-section.</p><p>“I guess I had babies today,” Ballinger said after the infants, a son and a daughter, arrived four minutes apart. “That was crazy. … We couldn’t film it. It was too fast, too hectic, too scary. It was really insane. I’m OK. They are OK, but they’re going to be in the NICU for a little.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Colleen-Ballinger-Gives-Birth-Welcomes-Twins-With-Husband-Erik-Stocklin-0001.jpg><p>The little ones arrived six months after the Haters Back Off alum’s pregnancy announcement.</p><p>“I can’t believe I’m pregnant with TWINS,” Ballinger told her Instagram followers in May. “A lot of people have asked how Flynn reacted to the news. He is very excited and loves giving the babies kisses … but now he thinks everyone has babies in their tummy. Including himself. Lol he’s gonna be an incredible brother and I’m so grateful for all his cuddles and kisses when I’m feeling nauseous.”</p><p>Her partner shared the news with a post of his own, writing, “Party of five.” She and the actor went on to share the sex of their upcoming arrivals in July.</p><p>“I have a little son and a little daughter in me,” the singer said in a YouTube video at the time. “I’m so excited. Oh, my God, I can’t believe it! This is, like, the best day ever. This was such a magical experience for me. I thought I wasn’t gonna know the genders of the babies for at least another month.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Colleen-Ballinger-Gives-Birth-Welcomes-Twins-With-Husband-Erik-Stocklin-0002.jpg><p>The actress<a href=#> showed her baby bump progress</a> throughout her pregnancy, writing via Instagram in September that it had been a “painful, draining [and] awful” experience.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“This pregnancy has been … not fun. No ‘pregnancy glow’ for me,” she captioned a photo of her bare belly. “Somehow, I’m surviving and I’m really excited to meet my new lil’ boy and girl this winter. I just wish I could sleep through the last three to four months of pregnancy and wake up to those cute little muffins in my arms. I get to have double the cuddles!! Double the kisses!! Double the newborn cuteness! I’m so excited!”</p><p>The vlogger and Stocklin<a href=#> tied the knot</a> in 2018 in California, welcoming Flynn in December of that same year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGacp5yhsqa6jJuYpaSZo7SmvoygoK%2Bdo2Kvqr7ToWSwnZyYvK6x0marsKGeqHq4tdOhZJ6qmaN6tMDOnKKloZ5k</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
