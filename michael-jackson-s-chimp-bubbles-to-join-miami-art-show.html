Founder Patti Ragan says despite Bubbles former lavish life, the animal has grown a liking to the environment.</p><p>Bubbles, 34, was sent to a California sanctuary in 2004 after he became unsuitable&nbsp;to live among Jackson and his children. He was then sent to the Center for Great Apes after the sanctuary closed down in 2005.&nbsp;“They have different tastes, just like humans,” Ragan said. “Some don’t like to paint. Others get interested in it and paint and paint and paint. Painting is just one of many enrichment activities that helps them rehabilitate from their time in captivity.”</p><p>There have been books and films about Jackson’s friendship with Bubbles but a new project came to light during the&nbsp;Cannes Film Festival. In May it was reported that Netflix obtained the rights to a stop-motion animated series about Bubbles’ life. <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a> notes the sale was just under $20 million.</p><p>Shortly after the Netflix purchase was made public, Jackson’s family released a statement condemning the project. “To clear up any confusion or misperceptions about unsanctioned <a href=# id=auto-tag_michael-jackson_1 data-tag=michael-jackson>Michael Jackson</a> projects currently in the news — including a Lifetime television movie and an animated film script recently purchased by Netflix — the Estate of Michael Jackson does not license or permit the use of any rights it owns, including to Michael’s music, images, video and films, for use in unauthorized works seeking to exploit Michael’s legacy,” the statement reads. “The Estate itself has numerous projects in development, all of which respect, honor and celebrate Michael’s life and legacy along with his extraordinary artistry that touched fans throughout the world. When the executors are ready to announce them, they will. As Michael said countless times about his own work, the quality goes in before the name goes on.”</p><p>The&nbsp;“Apes That Paint” exhibit will kick off July 21 at the Frames USA & Art Gallery.</p><p>Find out more information <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6K2pLTAnqNmopGYuLS7zaxkqZ2kYrCptcypZJutkpe5pr%2BMpqCapZlirrPAjKyfqK9dan9zgpJvZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
