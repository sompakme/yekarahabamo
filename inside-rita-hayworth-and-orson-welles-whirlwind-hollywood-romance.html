He was immediately drawn to her.</p><p>"<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I saw that fabulous still in Life magazine</a> where she's on her knees in bed. And that's when I decided: 'When I come back, that's what I'm going to do!'" Welles would tell Leaming.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The director kept his promise. Once back in Hollywood, he, then 28, asked Hayworth, 25, on a date. The pair hit it off right away.</p><p>That same year, Welles and Hayworth, together with one of his frequent collaborators, actor Joseph Cotten, worked on The Mercury Wonder Show, a radio magic variety aimed at boosting World War II troops' morale.

Reportedly, Welles picked Hayworth up during her lunch break while she was filming Cover Girl. They got married in Santa Monica, with Cotten serving as best man.</p><p>"I never saw a happier, more tickled, more delighted, adorable couple in the world," studio secretary Shifra Haran told Leaming.</p><p>You can hear it for yourself in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview Hayworth and Welles gave</a>, together with Dietrich, on the day of their wedding.
