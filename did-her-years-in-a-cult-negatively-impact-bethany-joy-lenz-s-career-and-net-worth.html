For instance, there was talk that <a href=#>Adam Driver's relatives were in alleged cult The Odyssey Group</a>. Stars don't often comment on these rumors. In the case of One Tree Hill star Bethany Joy Lenz, she spoke out about being in a cult on her podcast Drama Queens, and she explained that she spent ten years under their control.</p><p>It makes sense that Lenz opened up about this terrible experience on the podcast considering the fact that she's still <a href=#>good friends with her One Tree Hill co-stars</a> and podcast co-hosts. Here's the truth about whether Bethany Joy Lenz's career was impacted because she was in a cult.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-to-bethany-joy-lenz-39-s-career-and-net-worth-when-she-was-in-a-cult>What Happened To Bethany Joy Lenz's Career And Net Worth When She Was In A Cult?</h2><p>In an interview with Variety, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bethany Joy Lenz talked about the cult</a> that she was part of and shared that she was a member <strong>"the entirety of my time on 'One Tree Hill.'"</strong> Since she was part of this organization while she was on One Tree Hill, it doesn't sound like it changed her acting career completely. She still came to work every day and she was still able to continue with her career once One Tree Hill ended.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/id-bethany-joy-lenz-secretly-date-her-one-tree-hill-co-star-chad-michael-murray_.jpg><p>However, there was a project that Bethany Joy Lenz wanted to be cast in, and she wasn't able to because of the cult. It sounds like this was a heartbreaking experience for the actress. This also meant losing out on some money.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bethany-joy-lenz-and-paul-johansson-one-tree-hill.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Why Do One Tree Hill Fans Think Paul Johansson And Bethany Joy Lenz Dated?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Paul Johansson and Bethany Joy Lenz starred as very different characters on hit teen drama One Tree Hill, and fans wonder about their relationship.</span><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lenz talked about the cult</a> with The Daily Mail and said that she was always passionate about musical theater. When she was cast in a Broadway production of Beauty and the Beast as Belle, she was thrilled. But members of the cult said that "rest" was more important and that she needed to say no.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lenz said:</p><p>"It was totally my absolute Broadway dream role. I had auditioned, and then I went in again and I read for producers, and then I had a work session with the musical director. And I got the offer, and I couldn't believe that."</p><p>As she told The Daily Mail, Lenz was glad that she didn't star in the production because she would have gone down another path in life that meant she would never have married her ex-husband and become a mom to her daughter. Still, it must have been awful to be influenced to say no to such an exciting opportunity.</p><p>But, since she worked steadily while in the cult, Lenz kept earning her One Tree Hill salary. The OTH actors earned a high salary and are said to have <a href=#>earned $100,000 for every season 4 episode</a>. Lenz was a main cast member throughout every season, which means that she continually earned a lot of money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lenz has a net worth of $1 million</a></strong>. Although she has a lower net worth than many other actors, Lenz has explored creative avenues other than acting. She is a talented singer who has released a few albums. She was also married to Michael Galeotti for almost a decade and has been raising her daughter Maria Rose Galeotti since 2011. While Lenz has acted fairly frequently since One Tree Hill, she has had other things keeping her busy, which could explain why her net worth isn't in the millions.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/hilarie-burton-bethany-joy-lenz-sophia-bush-one-tree-hill.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>What Bethany Joy Lenz Has Said About Her One Tree Hill Co-Stars</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Lenz played Haley James on teen drama 'One Tree Hill' between 2003 and 2012.</span><p>However, even though Lenz was able to keep acting, it was of course terrible to be part of a cult for such a long time. Lenz explained that her fellow cast members knew that she was in the cult, which must have been a tough experience for everyone involved.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In her interview with Variety, Lenz explained why she began talking about what she went through:</p><p>"I was beginning to feel like I was hiding something because it was such an integral part of my personal journey while I was on 'One Tree Hill.' As we’re just talking about all the behind the scenes, we keep talking about all the times everybody was hanging out. I keep saying, 'Wish I had been there.'
