His masterful track selections and seamless transitions showed off his talent, creativity and longevity in the electronic music scene. But then nothing but the best is expected from someone whose mentors consist of legendary Detroit DJs Derrick May, Juan Atkins, and Kevin Saunderson.</p><p>For those yearning for more of Stacey Pullen’s Motor City influenced sound check him out at Sankeys New York on Dec 28th, celebrate with him for NYE at Stereo in Montreal, or party with him on the beaches of Playa at the BPM Festival from Jan 3rd to the 12th.
