Bristowe was accompanied by Zac Clark, sparking rumors about their potential romance. In January, she had to refute allegations of cheating on Tartick with Clark, after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">a video from a New Year’s Eve party showed them looking cozy</a>.</p><p>Bristowe and Tartick's four-year engagement ended in August 2023, surprising many fans. Although the breakup initially seemed amicable, tensions rose when Bristowe accused Tartick of playing the "victim" to gain sympathy post-split. Tartick and Stickler were later reported to be dating in April and made their relationship Instagram official in June.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, some fans think Kaitlyn wants to get attention from the situation by acting similarly to her man’s new girlfriend, though he’s pushing back.</p><p>Kaitlyn Bristowe first gained public attention through her participation in the popular reality TV series, The Bachelor. She appeared on the show's 19th season, which premiered in 2015. Competing for the affection of Chris Soules, Bristowe quickly became a fan favorite due to her vibrant personality and sharp wit. Although she did not win Soules' heart, finishing in third place, her charm and charisma earned her a significant following.</p><p>Her journey in the Bachelor franchise didn't end there. In March 2015, Kaitlyn was announced as one of the two potential Bachelorettes for the 11th season of The Bachelorette. The premiere, which also aired in 2015, featured a unique twist where the male contestants voted between Bristowe and Britt Nilsson to determine who would be the Bachelorette. Kaitlyn won the majority vote, securing her place as the star of the season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZmpuYmrmwvsStq55lo6mus3nKmqCtpKmjeqO%2ByKyrqK%2BVYq6lsNGeqqydo2Kwra3Ipqpmm5%2Blxqq6xmacsatdnLazuMWroJ6mlGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
