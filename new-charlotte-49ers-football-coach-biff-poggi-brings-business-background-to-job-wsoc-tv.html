A guy with deep connections to Pittsburgh who made some serious money as an investor and hedge-fund trader who’s come to Charlotte to pursue his football ambitions. Sure, that describes David Tepper and his $18.5 billion fortune, including the NFL Carolina Panthers and MLS team Charlotte FC.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">But as of this month, it describes Biff Poggi — that name sounds like football — who was introduced today at Jerry Richardson Stadium as the Charlotte 49ers’ new football coach. UNC Charlotte Chancellor Sharon Gaber and Athletic Director Mike Hill have high expectations for Poggi. But Poggi seemed determined to embrace loftier goals, telling reporters in a more informal chat afterwards that he expects to win the conference crown next season.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">If he can reach half of his goals, Poggi — pronounced “Poe-GEE” — is likely to be a hit in University City. At 62, Poggi is mostly a football lifer: He played with Dan Marino at Pitt in college and, after early experiences in coaching and teaching, Poggi accepted an offer from his father-in-law to try a career in investing. They did well, but Poggi eventually gravitated back to coaching.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">He built a high school program and, more recently, became the Wolverine whisperer as associated head coach at Michigan, credited by head coach Jim Harbaugh with helping the program find its way back to championship level. Before he takes over the 49ers program full time, Poggi has a business trip to Columbus this weekend as Michigan faces Ohio State in a top-5 matchup that will likely send the winner to the College Football Playoff.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">As for business, Poggi seems like an ideal fit for the 49ers and Charlotte. During his introductory remarks at Jerry Richardson Stadium this morning, Poggi mentioned his business background and went on to point out Charlotte’s status as a financial-services powerhouse.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph"><a href=#>Keep reading here.</a></p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph"><i><b>(WATCH BELOW: ‘Most courageous’: Boy who died of cancer left his mark on Charlotte 49ers football team)</b></i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cmg-cmg-tv-10030-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/VslimaSBHlzhvf6I37WbpXbhyn8=/800x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/d1hfln2sfez66z.cloudfront.net/03-16-2022/t_9fc1865b42844af1b0cb7f9cbddaa5be_name_T1B__UNCC_pediatric_cancer_patient_transfer_frame_626.jpeg"><p class="ImageMetadata__MetadataParagraph-sc-1gn0vty-0 gAFIWJ image-metadata"><span class=title>‘Most courageous’: Boy who died of cancer left his mark on Charlotte 49ers football team</span></p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph body-copyright">©2022 Cox Media Group</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL%2FOnKuvZpOkunC6xLCqaKSfmK6te82ermabmJa%2FrbvTrZxmbGmav7R5xaimrZqRoblur86amqFlkp6zp3nPqJ6goV2Xv6q6xqxkm62jnrumv9JmmZqbm5y%2FsMHNnWSjp5JkhImRlo2JioN5f46XjqOMjpGEemuilZW4inho</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
