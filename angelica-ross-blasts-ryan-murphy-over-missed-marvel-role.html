She aired out how his lack of communication caused her to miss out on a role with <a href=# id=auto-tag_marvel data-tag=marvel>Marvel</a> that she’d been auditioning for three years.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Ross <a rel=nofollow href=#>tweeted</a> alleged screenshots from a July 2020 email exchange between her and Murphy regarding a potential AHS series with an <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234719424>all-Black, female-led cast</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He wrote, “Remember your idea about a HORROR season starring Black women? Well, I’m doing it. Not sure of the story yet, but we will start a writers room in the fall. Along with you, who are the four women I should get? I think you, <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234777449>Keke Palmer</a>, [Gabourey Sidibe]… not sure of the fourth?”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The now 42-year-old replied, “YAAAAAASSSSS!” She went on to advocate for <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234766502>Debbi Morgan</a>, Alfre Woodard, Adina Porter, Angela Bassett, and<a href=# data-type=pmc-gallery data-id=1234756972> Amiyah Scott</a> before concluding, “I honestly have a long list of Black women I want to work with — Gabrielle Union, Viola Davis, Lupita [Nyong’o], Kerry Washington, Halle Berry, the list definitely goes on!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_7911.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">However, it seems Murphy ghosted Ross regarding the <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234728062>potential series</a>, causing her to miss out on joining the <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234786056>Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>. She confirmed that she emailed the Glee creator one last time in February 2022.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“After not hearing back. After sending flowers and no response I sent one last email in Feb 2022 (it took about a year to film season 10 due to COVID) while still contractually in first position with the show. Mind you, marvel had called twice now. I haven’t heard from him since. #SAGAFTRAstrike,” Ross tweeted.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_7909.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">To clarify, Ross explained she isn’t solely upset about Murphy not committing to <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234741274>the new series</a>, but rather about the principle and how she was left in limbo over a role she wanted.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">She <a href=# rel=nofollow>explained</a>, “It’s not JUST that the idea changed. Things change all the time. It’s that I called business affairs for MONTHS trying to get clarity if they were picking up my contract option or if I was ok to tell Marvel that I was available for whatever they were calling me for. I had been auditioning for THREE YEARS for marvel. It’s that I was HELD in first position the whole time.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234736302>LGBTQ+ advocate</a> later added that this isn’t the end of what she has to say on the matter, but it is an emotional situation that took over a year to process.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Please ask somebody about me. If I’m at the point of publicly showing receipts you can believe I don’t have any f**ks left to give when it comes down to it. And I’m not even done pulling out the receipts,” Ross <a rel=nofollow href=#>tweeted</a>. “It took me about a year and some months to process all of this so that I could speak without crying or getting too angry. Because we know how y’all respond to ‘angry Black women.’ So I’m about to lay out all the facts for you. But I have to take care of myself in the process.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Ross made history as the first female transgender actress to land two roles as a series regular after portraying Candy Ferocity in Pose, and Donna Chambers in American Horror Story: 1984. Murphy has not publicly responded to Ross’ comments.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_7913.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5a7qLHLopqaZaKkwLR50bKYp2Wdqr%2BxtNhmpJqqppq5bq3LpWSbpJGYuG6tzJ6popuRo3qpu9Grpqtlo6m8s8WMamlsbGduf3GCkmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
