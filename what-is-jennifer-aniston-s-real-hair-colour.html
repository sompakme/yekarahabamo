The star later appeared in a number of films throughout the 90s and later landed the role of a lifetime playing Rachel Green on the hit Warner Brothers show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Friends"</a>. While Rachel played a fashionista with a hairstyle to kill, it seems as if her iconic hairdo was not a truthful depiction of what her real hair color is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While most of us know Jennifer Aniston as a blonde or light brunette with highlights to match, it seems as if we have all been hoodwinked, I tell ya! The actress has kept her hair dyed throughout the course of her lengthy career, which fans have loved and adored, but she certainly looks a lot different than <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her younger years!</a> Despite her looking stunning as a blonde, this is what Jennifer Aniston's hair color really is!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Friends: How Much Did Jennifer Aniston Get Paid For The Show?</a></span></p><h2 id=brunette-to-blonde>Brunette To Blonde?</h2><p>Prior to joining the cast of "Friends" and taking on the role of Rachel Green, Jennifer Aniston had appeared in a number of successful films and television shows, including "Ferris Bueller", "Leprechaun", and "Muddling Through", all of which allowed Aniston to make a name for herself. While the star may have had a boost at the start of her career, considering her father, John Aniston, had been in the business long before she was, but if there was one thing that stood out apart from her skills as an actress, was hee stunning hairdo!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Aniston sported a light brunette hairstyle during the early days of "Friends", with some highlights, the actress went full blonde later on in the 90s and decided to keep that as her signature lookup until this very day. Despite being a stunning blonde, Jennifer Aniston by no means has light hair, in fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she's a true brunette!</a>&nbsp;While she looks great as both, fans wondered why the star decided to ditch the brown hair and move over to blonde hair.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Jennifer Aniston And Courteney Cox: Facts About Their Friendship</a></span></p><p>According to Insider, Aniston decided to make the switch over to blonde permanently as it is designed to bring out her eyes. The actress has beautiful blue eyes, which is not very common for brunettes, so the switch over to blonde hair, definitely allowed for her eye color to pop far more than when she was a brunette. The star visits her colorist, Michael Canalé, who created the iconic "The Rachel" hairstyle, quite often and the process isn't as complicated as you might think.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Canalé, who has now been dyeing Aniston's hair for over 24 years, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">blends Jennifer's highlights to look as natural as possible. </a>This creates a seamless and effortless color that looks so natural, it practically convinced millions of people&nbsp;that she really is a blonde! With impressive work like that, there's a reason why Canalé is one of the best, and we're certain Jennifer Aniston agrees!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>This Is How Adam Sandler And Jennifer Aniston First Met</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecmepaehlpq%2Fbq3Noqqtp56oerOxwKVkoZmZp3qku8uorKtn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
