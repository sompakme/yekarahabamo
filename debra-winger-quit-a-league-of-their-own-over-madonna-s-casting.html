As for what she thought of Madonna, Winger said, “I think [her] acting career has spoken for itself.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Tom-Hanks-Rosie-ODonnell-Madonna-A-League-of-Their-Own.jpg><p>A League of Their Own is making a comeback, as Amazon is <a href=#>adapting the film as a series</a> — and O’Donnell, 59, is set to make a cameo.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Twenty-eight years ago, <strong>Penny Marshall</strong> told us a story about women playing professional baseball that up until then had been largely overlooked,” the TV show’s creators, <strong>Abbi Jacobson</strong> and <strong>Will Graham</strong>, said in a statement in 2020 of the upcoming show. “We grew up obsessed with the film, like everyone else. Three years ago, we approached Sony with the idea of telling a new, still overlooked set of those stories. With the help of an enormously talented team of collaborators, an amazing cast, and the devoted support of Amazon to this project, we feel beyond lucky and excited to get to bring these characters to life. It took grit, fire, authenticity, wild imagination and a crackling sense of humor for these players to achieve their dreams. We’re hoping to bring audiences a story with all of those qualities.”</p><p>O’Donnell, who played Doris Murphy in the ‘90s film, will return as a bartender at the local gay bar in the new series, she revealed on the “Everything Iconic With Danny Pellegrino” podcast earlier this month. “I had a great experience on A League of Their Own,” she added. “I love the Broad City women and when I was told [Abbi] was doing League, she called me up and said, ‘Ro, would you do it?’ And I said, ‘In a minute.’ … Then she sent me the pilot that she did and it was just really beautiful.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJuemqKWeri1zaCcq2Whqra1ecBmo56Zl6qybrvFZquhnZmnerDDzWamr52iYrqisM6npZqrXZiutMDIp55o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
