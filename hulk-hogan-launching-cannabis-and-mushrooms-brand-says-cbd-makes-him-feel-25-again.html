When talking about all of the injuries he’s been through in his career, Hogan revealed that CBD and THC have him feeling better than he’s felt in a very long time.</p><p>“I always joke about I didn’t get the memo that this stuff was ‘fake’ and after the 10 back surgery and two knees and two hips, it’s just a situation of you do get hurt out there all the time,” Hulk Hogan said. “I feel better than I’ve ever felt at 69 years old, I feel like I’m 25 again.”</p><p>Hogan said moving away from pain pills to the CBD world has really helped improve his overall health.</p><p>“It definitely helped me because as I said the slow walk back from the prescription drugs ended with me downing the Tylenol and the Advil and Aleve’s and finally even that wasn’t working for me,” Hulk Hogan said. “As I moved away from that and got into the CBD world, it really changed the game from my sleep to the inflammation, the way my wrists and my joints hurt, across the board, it helped me with my health.”</p><p>Hogan is such a believer in the power of CBD and THC that he’s partnering up with Carma HoldCo to create his own cannabis line, following in the footsteps of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mike Tyson and Ric Flair</a>.</p><p>“When I saw what Ric and Mike were doing, I instantly wanted to get on the team because you use CBD for energy, for sleep, for fitness — it just made sense,” Hulk Hogan said. “It’s a logical extension of where I already was but this is the safe way to approach things instead of that wild card way of doctor’s prescription stuff. It just didn’t make sense anymore.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tyson 2.0</a>&nbsp;Chairman Chad Bronstein and Ric Flair <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke with WrestleZone</a> about the latter’s partnership with Mike Tyson.</p><p>“For me personally, this will be the biggest venture I’ve ever been in. This will be the biggest venture, wrestling, bar none. This opportunity to work with Chad and Mike is the biggest opportunity I’ve ever had in my life, and I’m more excited about that than I have been a lot of things,” Flair said. “To be working with this Ric Flair Drip and with Chad and Mike, it’s the most exciting part of my life right now. That’s just it, it’s the biggest thing I’ve ever done. I can say that for myself personally.”</p><p>Flair talked about how grueling his travel schedule used to be and now sees the benefits of cannabis.</p><p>“I can tell you right now that two of the biggest problems, and I’m not just gonna put it in the wrestling business, but in sports, is getting up and getting down. A lot of guys need a lift in the morning, whether it be an energy drink or something, like coffee. But when you run as hard as we do and it’s four o’clock in the morning, [cannabis is] much, much, much safer [than using other medications like Ambien as a sleep aid], especially on the international tours where you’re gonna get off the plane and go to work that night,” Flair explained.</p><p><a href=#>Sting Still Can’t Figure Out How WCW Screwed Up The Finish At Starrcade ’97</a></p><p>What do you make of Hulk Hogan’s comments?
