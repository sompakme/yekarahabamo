Adopt a dog,” Morris joked in her post, listing off the steps she’s taken recently. “Get back on antidepressants.”</p><p>Us Weekly <a href=#>confirmed last month that Morris filed for divorce</a> from Hurd, 37, on October 2 after five years of marriage, citing irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split. The exes have a prenup in place.</p><p><a href=#>Hurd “wasn’t expecting” Morris to file</a> for divorce, a source told Us late last month. Her decision “seems to have come out of the blue.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Maren-Morris-Jokes-It-s-Time-for-Her-Annual-Existential-Crisis-Following-Ryan-Hurd-Split-025.jpg><p>The insider explained that Morris and Hurd are “opposites,” which could have made their relationship “difficult.”</p><p>Morris and Hurd met in 2014 when they cowrote <a href=#><strong>Tim McGraw</strong></a>’s song “Last Turn Home.” Their friendship eventually turned romantic, with Hurd proposing two years later. He and Morris tied the knot in March 2018. They welcomed son Hayes, now 3, in March 2020.</p><p>Morris was spotted at various events without her wedding ring in the days after she filed for divorce, but the breakup news had not gone public yet. When she played a show in Chicago in celebration of <a href=#>her The Bridge EP</a>, fans noticed after the fact that she <a href=#>performed without the ring on that finger</a>.</p><p>Days later, Morris attended the premiere of <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>‘s concert movie <a href=#>Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour</a> in Los Angeles and was once again without her ring on the red carpet.</p><p>When Morris broke her social media silence following the divorce news, she seemingly alluded to the <a href=#>breakup in a cryptic post</a>.</p><p>“It will be fine,” she wrote via Instagram Stories on October 20, sharing a selfie with her wedding ring off. “It will just be, and when it is, you will face what’s necessary.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite the split, it seems there’s no bad blood between Morris and Hurd, as the duo recently <a href=#>reunited to go trick-or-treating with their son</a>. Morris shared a photo of herself and Hurd smiling as they held Hayes’ hand on October 31. He was dressed as a dinosaur while Morris and Hurd were bundled up. (Hayes’ face was covered with a white heart emoji in the photo.)</p><p>Throughout their time together, Morris and Hurd were open about their love and its ups and downs, especially after a “tough summer” in 2018.</p><p>“We have grown so much closer because we had to make some hard decisions and have some tough talks about what this future looks like and how we can make this better,” Morris told Esquire in 2019. “I have always loved him, but I feel like I like him in ways I never knew I could before.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGammaKau265zqupoqtdpb%2BmvMCrnKxllqS%2Fbq3Np6yapF2axaq%2F056lraGRoXqkvsisoKxlkZvBpr6MnaCvp6KYsnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
