Every person that trusted me with their image, I’m so grateful for you all,” he captioned the March 14 upload.</p><p>Roach continued, “If this business was just about the clothes I would do it for the rest of my life but unfortunately it’s not! The politics, the lies and false narratives finally got me! You win … I’m out. ❤️❤️❤️.”</p><p>After fans quickly assumed his retirement <a href=#>was a result of a feud with Zendaya</a>, Roach clarified that there was no bad blood between him and the <a href=#>Euphoria</a> star. “[Zendaya] is my little sister and it’s real love not the fake industry love,” he said via a <a href=#>series of tweets</a> that same month. “So y’all really think I’m breaking up with Z … we are forever!”</p><p>Roach did reveal, however, he decided to retire <a href=#>without consulting Zendaya beforehand</a>. “It was tough for her,” he said during a March 21 appearance on <a href=#><strong>Emily Ratajkowski</strong></a>’s <a href=#>“High Low with EmRata” podcast</a>. “[Zendaya] called and said, ‘Girl, I thought we’d make big decisions together. Of course, she supported me and was like, ‘Do you need me to send you on a vacation? Tell me what you’re going through.’”</p><p>Despite working as a stylist for A-listers such as <a href=#><strong>Kerry Washington</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Megan Thee Stallion</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Hunter Schafer</strong></a> and more, Roach explained to Zendaya that he had been “unhappy” for a “really long time,” especially following the death of his 3-year-old nephew in November 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Zendaya-Wishes-a-Happy-Birthday-to-My-Dear-Stylist-Law-Roach-Following-His-Retirement-News-440.jpg><p>One month later, he joined Zendaya for a red carpet appearance at the opening of the <a href=#>Nita Mukesh Ambani Cultural Centre in India</a>. He rocked a multicolored floral ensemble by <strong>Rahul Mishra</strong> paired with Bulgari jewels. Zendaya also wore a Mishra-designed look comprised of a sheer, violet sari and a gold embroidered bralette.</p><p>Zendaya’s <a href=#>boyfriend</a>, <a href=#><strong>Tom Holland</strong></a>, also joined the pair at the event, though he walked the red carpet solo. The <a href=#>Spider-Man</a> star kept things classy in a sleek black suit and white dress shirt.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Not long after he left his role as a stylist did Roach <a href=#>make his modeling debut</a>. He walked the Boss spring/summer 2023 runway show in March donning a crisp lavender suit and brown dress shoes alongside celebrities such as <a href=#><strong>Pamela Anderson</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Naomi Campbell</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>DJ Khaled</strong></a>.</p><p>“I’m grateful that the Boss team sees me as more than just someone who dresses all these amazing celebrities,” he told <a href=#>Vogue</a> at the time, clarifying that his retirement was not from the fashion industry as a whole. “I love fashion. I love the business, and I love being creative. What I’m retiring from is the celebrity styling part of it: the being in service and at [the] service of other people. That’s what I’m retiring from.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6%2Byr7DAsphmr5motaa%2FjJ2cmqpdqMG6uMisq2akkax6s7vAnJ9mmV2drrG82GaZoqqknbGixY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
