The list, published on Friday, May 17, states that Charles is currently the 258th wealthiest person in the U.K. with a personal wealth amount of approximately $770 million (a.k.a. around 606 million pounds.)</p><p>Charles is reportedly over $300 million richer than Elizabeth was prior to her <a href=#>September 2022 death</a>. Per the outlet’s <a href=# rel=noopener>2022 Rich List</a>, Elizabeth amassed a personal wealth of $486 million before she passed away at age 96. Charles’ personal wealth has also increased by around $12 million since last year’s Rich List.</p><p>Ranking higher than Charles on the list is his eldest grandson Prince George’s godfather, <strong>Hugh Grosvenor</strong>, the Duke of Westminster, with a family net worth of around $12.8 billion. The outlet also reports that Charles’ most valuable assets are England’s Sandringham Estate and Scotland’s Balmoral Castle.</p><p>According to the outlet, a former aide of Charles’ claims he managed to rebuild his wealth by saving profits earned from his former $1 billion estate, the Duchy of Cornwall, after his 1996 divorce from <strong>Princess Diana</strong> cost him $21 million. The Duchy of Cornwall was <a href=#>inherited by Prince William</a> following Elizabeth’s death.</p><p>Charles was officially crowned as the King of England during his <a href=#>May 2023 coronation</a>. He was later diagnosed with an <a href=#>unspecified form of cancer</a> back in February after undergoing a procedure for an <a href=#>enlarged prostate</a> the month prior. He made his <a href=#>return to royal duties</a> at Buckingham Palace in March and resumed public appearances in April by visiting a <a href=#>cancer treatment center</a> with his wife, <strong>Queen Camilla</strong>, last month.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/King-Charles-III-Is-Officially-Richer-Than-Queen-Elizabeth-II-Details-02.jpg><p>Earlier this week, Charles’ <a href=#>first official portrait</a> since his coronation was revealed. “The painting – commissioned by The Draper’s Company – is the first official portrait to be completed since His Majesty’s Coronation,” the royal family captioned a pic of the portrait <a href=# rel=noopener>via X</a> on Tuesday, May 14. “It will hang in Draper’s Hall in London.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The photo featured Charles dressed in military garb and <a href=#>covered by a red hue</a>, except his face. “The red was inspired by the Welsh Guards, but I wanted the painting to be a little more contemporary and not get in the way of seeing the face and the personality,” artist <strong>Jonathan Yeo</strong> said of his artwork’s bold color choice, per <a href=# rel=noopener>Hello</a>. “The color was an early experiment and then I sketched it out and worked on the face, and the face and background worked so well.”</p><p>Two days after the portrait reveal, Camilla, 76, <a href=#>shared an update</a> on her husband’s health while attending a garden party in Rye, England. “[He’s] getting better,” she said in a <a href=# rel=noopener>social media clip</a> from the Thursday, May 16, outing, jokingly adding, “Well, he would if he behaved himself.”</p><p>Charles is not the only royal currently <a href=#>battling cancer</a> as the palace announced in March that <strong>Princess Kate Middleton</strong> is undergoing preventative chemotherapy after <a href=#>cancer was discovered</a> by her doctors following a January abdominal procedure. <strong>Sarah Ferguson</strong>, ex-wife of Charles’ brother <strong>Prince Andrew</strong>, also revealed in January that she had been <a href=#>diagnosed with skin cancer</a> after previously battling breast cancer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakoZ6ceqS0wKujnqtdnsBuu8WfoJyhkaG5unnRopqhnaJiwamtzWaorp2Vo3qmuMizmJudpJ16r7HTZq6oqqSderOx1Z6YpZ2UZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
