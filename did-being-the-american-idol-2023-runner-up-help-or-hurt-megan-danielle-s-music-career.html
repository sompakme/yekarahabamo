She came much closer to reality TV victory when she was the runner-up in season 21 of American Idol.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Megan Danielle didn't win American Idol 2023 and that honor went to Iam Tongi, she still got very far and should be super proud of her accomplishments. But how does Megan Danielle really feel about her time on American Idol? Does she think that the competition series has given her a leg up and helped her stand out in the crowded music industry?</p><h2 id=what-was-megan-danielle-39-s-american-idol-2023-experience-like>What Was Megan Danielle's American Idol 2023 Experience Like?</h2><p><a href=#>American Idol auditions have to be memorable</a>. That sometimes means that they are super dramatic or feature a performer who has a memorable voice that stops everyone in their tracks.</p><p>Megan Danielle has a moving and unforgettable background, and that likely enabled her to move forward during the audition process. According to Music Mayhem Magazine, she explained that she became a fan of music because of her close relationship with her grandfather, Chuck Bass. Every time Danielle talked about her relative, she tugged on people's heartstrings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/megan-danielle.jpg><p>Music Mayhem Magazine mentioned that when Danielle performed the song "You Say" by Lauren Daigle during her American Idol audition, Daigle performed alongside her. Daigle said, “Your story reminds me of my own so much, with your Grandfather.
