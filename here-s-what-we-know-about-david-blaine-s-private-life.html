The magician first began his career back in 1993 when he was only 20 years old! After decided to pursue magic full time, Blaine took to the streets to perform some of his most mindblowing tricks. It didn't take much time before he was on NBC for his first-ever television special showcasing his incredible talent. This was definitely the start of something big for David, and it certainly was!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The star would soon take on a number of dangerous and physical endurance stunts that easily set him apart from his competition, which include big names such as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">David Copperfield</a> and Criss Angel. Whether it was electrifying himself, submerging himself in tanks of water, or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">floating thousands of feet into the air</a> via balloons, David has really done it all. While we know a lot about his career, we don't know much about his personal life, until now.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>15 Optical Illusions That Tripped Us Up</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-david-blaine>Who Is David Blaine?</h2><p>David Blaine began to devote his life to magic at 20 years old, after having dabbled with it here and there as a teenager. While he may have had to start from the bottom, being a street performer in New York City, it is clear that his hard work has paid off. Although we may know a lot about his career and incredible acts and performances, Blaine has kept his private life, well... private. It is safe to say he has attained fame and success but has his life been as great?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The magician was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">raised by a single mother,</a> who unfortunately passed from cancer a year after David had taken on magic full time. By 2003, Blaine had performed his "Above The Below" act, which catapulted him to nationwide fame. The star nearly ditched magic for good after having attended a performing arts school in Manhattan, however, he knew his true calling was always going to be magic.&nbsp;As he got more and more well known, David was all about the magic and left much to the imagination when it came to his life outside of his career.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Magician Bamboozles Dogs At Shelter</a></span></p><p>One area of Blaine's life that has been kept secret is his love life! While he has done a stellar job at keeping his romantic life on the down-low, it was revealed that he was once engaged to the French model, Alizee Guinochet. The duo were engaged back in 2009 but never made it down the aisle. The couple remained engaged for 5 years and welcomed their daughter, Dessa Blaine, in 2011. After their split in 2014, the magician has remained single ever since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The star also found himself in one scandal he couldn't magically get himself out of.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> David was accused of sexual assault</a> by 3 women in 2017. One incident reportedly took place in London, while the other two in New York. The allegations were later dropped and the case was closed.
