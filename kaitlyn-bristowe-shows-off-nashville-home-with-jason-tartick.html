It was slowly dying every month,” the “Off the Vine” podcast host said. “If I can’t take care of a cactus how am I going to take care of kids?”</p><p>When it came to the dining room, Bristowe opted for a “rock and roll, Nashville vibe.” She said, “I wanted everything to be really dark and sexy and edgy.” That feel was achieved with a dark navy wall, dark wood table and portraits of musicians on the walls.</p><p></p><p>The “If I’m Being Honest” singer’s bedroom, on the other hand, is all about comfort and knick-knacks.</p><p>“Jason and I disagree on this. I’m a fan of trinkets and little bits of beautiful clutter,” she said showing off hats, candles and photos all pushed together on a gold shelf.</p><p>Her bed, however, is the pride and joy of the room.</p><p>“When I moved to Nashville, I had a mattress on the floor,” Bristowe explained. “And I was like, my goal is to feel like I’m in a hotel bed but better because I love sleep. I wanted to make this a very calm room.”</p><p>The <a href=#>former Bachelorette</a> added: “We have separate closets and separate bathrooms and that, my friends, is key to a healthy and happy relationship.”</p><p>Bristowe noted that her upstairs area is her “happy place.” The space includes a swinging chair, an area for the reality star’s workout bike and a puzzle zone.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Poor Jason, I mean he moved into my house so it’s kinda funny, because, I’m, like, it’s so feminine in here,” she said, pointing to her white, fluffy chairs. She also explored Tartick’s bathroom, office and the site of their future gym. Plus, a look at her podcast headquarters — complete with a floral-printed wallpaper and antique mirror.</p><p>Check out Bristowe’s full house tour in the video above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuKK106Wwp2WSp7a0wM6wnGarmKTEtHnOn51mppGotbe1y6WcZqCforJuw8itn2aikai8r3nTmqmtoZOgfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
