But, by all accounts, he’s got no agenda when it comes to religion anymore – he’s past all that.”</p><p>However, Tom Cruise might have a hidden agenda when it comes to his career, as <strong>he allegedly believes befriending Taylor is a good strategic move</strong>.</p><p>“He’s still personally devoted to Scientology, but his primary concerns these days, aside from his career, is expanding his social network in the UK and beyond.”</p><h2 id=tom-cruise-attending-taylor-swift-39-s-concert-caused-controversy>Tom Cruise Attending Taylor Swift's Concert Caused Controversy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/tom-cruise-2024-glastonbury-festival-day-4.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's not only people in Taylor Swift's circle who had a problem with Tom Cruise's closeness to the singer.
