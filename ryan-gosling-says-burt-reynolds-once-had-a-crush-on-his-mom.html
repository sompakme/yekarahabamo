It’s complicated because I thought he took a shine to me, I thought he thought there was something special about me,” Gosling, 43, quipped on the Wednesday, May 1, episode of<a href=# rel=noopener> <i>Jimmy Kimmel Live! </i></a>“Then I realized I have a really beautiful mom. He was just kind of interested [and] it was like I was getting, like, a secondary shine. The real shine was for my mom.”</p><p class=p1>Gosling added, “And I was like, ‘Oh this is secondary shine.’ I wish I had found out sooner. Oh my God, she loved it, are you kidding me? Nothing happened, OK? Just say like, he just liked my [mom].”</p><p class=p1>Gosling noted that Reynolds was “friendly” to him on the set and even signed several pieces of merch.</p><p class=p1>“He [also] gave me this off piece of advice,” the <i>Fall Guy</i> star told Kimmel. “He was like, ‘Let me tell you something, kid: Don’t spend your whole life stepping over diamonds to live with a cubic zirconia.’ I was like, ‘I’m 13, I don’t know what any of those things are. I don’t know what any of that is but stop looking at my mom!’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ryan-Gosling-Says-Burt-Reynolds-Took-a-Shine-to-His-Mom-During-Frankenstein-and-Me-Production-2.jpg><p class=p1><i>Frankenstein and Me </i>was one of Gosling’s earliest film roles, where he starred opposite Reynolds. While Reynolds portrayed Les Williams, Gosling played the teen character of Kenny. The<strong> Robert Tinnell</strong>-directed picture followed 12-year-old Earl Williams (<strong>Jamieson Boulanger</strong>) after finding a Frankenstein doll fall off the back of a truck, fantasizing about bringing the monster to life.</p><p class=p1>Reynolds<a href=#> died in September 2018</a> at the age of 82 after suffering a heart attack.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Gosling, meanwhile, is very close with his mother, <strong>Donna</strong>. Gosling’s parents, who also share daughter <strong>Mandi</strong>, are divorced.</p><p class=p1>“I think like a girl, I think,” Gosling previously told <a href=# rel=noopener><i>The Independent </i></a>in a 2018 profile. “I was literally raised by my mother and my sister. And I just feel like I wouldn’t know how to think any other way. My sister was my best friend and my hero growing up. Because I was home-schooled I didn’t have a lot of friends and I did ballet, which was always just girls. All of that had an effect on my brain.”</p><p class=p1>Gosling even <a href=#>brought his mother as his date</a> to the Oscars in March, where he was up for Best Supporting Actor and performed “I’m Just Ken” live with several of his costars and legendary guitarist Slash. The actor’s longtime partner, <strong>Eva Mendes</strong>, <a href=#>watched the show</a> from backstage. (Gosling and Mendes, 50, share two daughters.)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarsZGjeqi70qWgp59dqK66v4ybrKusXaeyurrOpZusZZ%2BjsKZ5x5qbZpldmL%2B2v8dmpqdlmJ7AbrnOpmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
