The entertainer was last most active as the show DJ and host on The <a href=#><strong>Ellen DeGeneres</strong></a> Show, a role he played from 2017.He was part of the Ellen family until the long-running daytime talk show came to an end in May that year.tWitch actually revealed that he was <a href=#>happy to be seeing the culmination of the show</a>, and eager to be exploring options for a new chapter of his life. Unfortunately, that life would not last much longer, as he passed away from suicide just a little over a week before Christmas in 2022.The news of his sad demise was broken by <a href=#>his wife Allison Holker</a>, to whom he had been married for nearly ten years. In a statement released on December 14, she led the way in eulogizing her fallen husband, as she described him as “the backbone of our family, the best husband and father, and an inspiration to his fans.”<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>8 Moments On Ellen's Talk Show That Made Her Laugh Out Loud</a></span>Former boss Ellen also offered up a moving tribute to tWitch, as she asked his and her fans to “hug each other, and let people know we're there for them.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-ellen-degeneres-show-was-subject-to-allegations-of-toxicity-at-the-workplace>The Ellen DeGeneres Show Was Subject To Allegations Of Toxicity At The Workplace</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Ellen-D.jpg><p>In 2020, several former and current employees of The Ellen DeGeneres Show came forward with <a href=#>allegations of a toxic work environment</a>. The accusations included instances of sexual misconduct, racism, and intimidation.</p><p>Warner Bros. Television, the production company behind the show, conducted an internal investigation in response to the claims. They found that there had been “some deficiencies related to the show’s day-to-day management” and consequently promised that steps had been taken to address the issues that had been raised.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ellen herself addressed the accusations in a letter to her staff, in which she apologized and acknowledged that “things happened here that never should have happened.” She also insisted: That will now change, and I’m committed to ensuring this does not happen again.” In the same letter, the host shifted some blame to some of those working in leadership positions under her.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Despite Being Called Out For Gaslighting Taylor Swift Ages Ago, Ellen DeGeneres Showed No Remorse</a></span></p><p>As a consequence, in addition to the internal investigation, several high-level producers, including executive producers Ed Glavin, Kevin Leman, and Jonathan Norman, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">were fired from the show</a>. There were also alterations in work conditions, including paid time off and a handsome leave policy.</p><h2 id=what-did-stephen-ldquo-twitch-rdquo-boss-say-about-the-allegations-against-ellen-degeneres>What Did Stephen “tWitch” Boss Say About The Allegations Against Ellen DeGeneres?</h2><p>While most of the culpability for the said toxic work environment on Ellen was carried by others, most people still lay the bulk of the blame at the door of Ellen DeGeneres herself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She did herself acknowledge that buck stopped with her, and that she should have done a better job of safeguarding the interests of the people who worked so hard to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">make her show the success it became</a>.</p><p>In that regard, Ellen was way harder on herself than Stephen "tWitch" Boss was about the entire matter. The DJ had always shared a close friendship with her over the years, a relationship that went beyond the work that they did together. When she found herself under fire, he proved his loyalty and resolutely stood by her.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>8 Reasons Ellen DeGeneres Is Officially Canceled</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking to Us Weekly</a> in August 2020, tWitch revealed that he was bound by law not to reveal certain details of the investigation, but insisted that the little he could say was only positive. “I’ll just leave it at [this] until there’s a time where we can address more publicly: There’s been love and there will continue to be love,” he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-else-was-stephen-ldquo-twitch-rdquo-boss-known-for>What Else Was Stephen “tWitch” Boss Known For?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/stephen-twitch-boss-and-ellen.png><p>While he will probably be remembered best for his work as a DJ and co-executive producer on Ellen, Stephen “tWitch” Boss would have likely been proud of his successful career outside the show.
