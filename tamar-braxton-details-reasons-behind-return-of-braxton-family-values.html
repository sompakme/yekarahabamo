During her final days, this was something that became important to her. And I remember calling [Carlos King] in tears because I was so conflicted because I did not know what to do,” detailed the 47-year-old, per <a rel=nofollow href=#>WBLS.</a></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><a href=# id=auto-tag_traci-braxton data-tag=traci-braxton>Traci Braxton</a><a href=#> passed away </a>in 2022 after a private battle with cancer.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">She continued to detail. “Number two, my mother asked me to come back because she wanted the remaining of her daughters to finish a show that was so important, not to just this community, but to her as a mother and also to her daughters.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/TCDBRFA_EC001.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Lastly, the “Prettiest Girl” performer explained that things would be different, adding, “And number three, the reason why I came back is because they gave me all of my things that I deserved the first round.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Usually when you go to a network and you create a show so big as the Braxtons… you usually get like number one: a real producer credit, number two: producing opportunities to be able to have your own company and producer other shows and things like that. And also, a substantial amount to make you feel better about the situation, and they gave me those things,” she detailed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1021023794.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The Braxton Family Values revival <a href=#>was announced</a> earlier this year, bringing Tamar together with sisters Toni, Tawanda, Trina, and mother Evelyn on the silver screen, once again.
