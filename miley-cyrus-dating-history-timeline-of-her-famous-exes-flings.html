They tied the knot in December 2018 after getting engaged in May 2012. The <a href=#>pair split for good</a> in August 2019.</p><p>After a whirlwind rebound romance with <a href=#><strong>Kaitlynn Carter</strong></a> and a relationship with <a href=#><strong>Cody Simpson</strong></a>, Cyrus, who identifies as pansexual, <a href=#>got real about the highs and lows of her love life</a>.</p><p>“I’ve been in love three times, but I’ve been in love more than I’ve loved anyone else one time,” she told host <strong>Alex Cooper</strong> on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast in August 2020. “I think that kind of sticks around … I don’t believe in one true love because there are qualities people bring to your life that someone else won’t.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Hannah Montana</a> alum did not reveal who her three big loves were. She did, however, note that one of her past girlfriends has continued to pop up in her dreams.</p><p>“I’ve been in love [with] one person, who is a girl, who I still think about and dream about all the time,” she said. “But you just know that something doesn’t fit.”</p><p>Cyrus’ dating history has included both men and women, both before and after her divorce from Hemsworth. When it comes to what she wants in a partner, the “Wrecking Ball” singer is focused on someone in the same place as she is: sober.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“As of right now, <a href=#>having someone who is sober</a> — like a partner — is very sexual to me,” she said in August 2020. “As someone who’s living the sober lifestyle, don’t find your next partner at the club, put yourself in places you’ll be successful, you can control the people who will flow into your life and I control who comes in and who doesn’t.”</p><p>Scroll down to relive Cyrus’ complete dating history:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuqq4xLJknLGiqsBusMCtoKefXZ22tMDOq7BmrJmisq21zZ5kqJ5dnbKzecWapKito2KyubHSZp2loZ6cwHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
