Carpenter and Dobrik were spotted at Tao Chicago late Friday night and into the early hours on Saturday, August 5, according to <a href=#>Page Six</a>.</p><p>Carpenter previously teased what type of men she is interested in <a href=#>during her improvised “Nonsense” outro on Friday</a>. “This song catchier than chickenpox is / I bet your house is where my other sock is / Woke up this morning, thought I’d write a pop hit, ha-ha / How quickly can you take your clothes off? Pop quiz,” she sang for the crowd before adlibbing.</p><p>“Perhaps I am a d—k aficionado / Windy City blow and then I swallow / Now he calls it giving him Chicago,” Carpenter quipped during the Lollapalooza Aftershow, replacing the usual final verse.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Sabrina-Carpenter-Seemingly-Laughs-Off-David-Dobrik-Romance-Rumors-I-Don-t-Date-Lollapaloozas-428.jpg><p>During the main show earlier on Friday, the <a href=#>Girl Meets World</a> alum sang the last verse, once again dropping the spoken “That one’s not gonna make / Most of these aren’t gonna make” lines from the recorded version in favor of a NSFW line.</p><p>“Turn that d–k to stone / Call me Medusa / Choking on him, need Heimlich maneuver / Sorry I don’t date Lollapalooz-ers,” she belted during her outro, causing some fans to think Carpenter’s sassy Instagram post on Sunday was merely referencing her Lollapalooza set.</p><p>Carpenter’s love life has been a hot topic since summer 2020 <a href=#>when she was linked to <strong>Joshua Bassett</strong></a>. Romance rumors about the pair grew in January 2021 after <a href=#><strong>Olivia Rodrigo</strong></a> — whom many fans thought had a secret relationship with Bassett in 2020 that ended when Carpenter entered the picture — released her hit song “Driver’s License.”</p><p>Fans speculated at the time that Rodrigo, 20, was referring to Carpenter when she sang, “And you’re probably with that blonde girl / Who always made me doubt / She’s so much older than me / She’s everything I’m insecure about,” seemingly hinting at Carpenter’s hair and age.</p><p>Rodrigo and Bassett, 22, never confirmed whether they were ever an item. Carpenter, for her part, was accused of releasing a diss track about Rodrigo with “Skin,” which dropped in January 2021.</p><p>“Maybe we could’ve been friends / If I met you in another life,” Carpenter sings at one point in the track. She later seemingly referenced Rodrigo’s title, with the lyric, “Don’t drive yourself insane.” Carpenter, however, <a href=#>denied the rumors via Instagram</a> and called Rodrigo’s “Driver’s License” a “magnificent” tune.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Carpenter was then linked to <a href=#><strong>Shawn Mendes</strong></a> in February after they were spotted having dinner in Los Angeles. The following month, the pair were seen exiting the Gucci store in Beverly Hills before attending <a href=#><strong>Miley Cyrus</strong></a>’ Endless Summer Vacation <a href=#>release party that month</a>.</p><p>“We are not dating,” Mendes, 24, <a href=#>told the Dutch TV program RTL Boulevard</a> in March while promoting his partnership with Tommy Hilfiger. “But I think we should talk about Tommy Hilfiger probably more than Sabrina. Thank you.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasmZKntq%2BtjJyYq6iVo8GmvoysnJ6lmaO0rcWMpZiun5ioerCyxWabmq6ZmXqlu8GroKRloqS6orrCnmSrrZ2kv7R7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
