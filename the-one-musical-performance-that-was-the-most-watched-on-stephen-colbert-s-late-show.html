Monster discussed if conquering the US was a goal, or something that just randomly happened.</p><p>"It was actually totally unexpected. I mean, we expected something… We're gaining some attention in the U.S. but we were like, “Could we make the top 10?” We sometimes imagined it, but never thought we could really do it. We wanted to but didn’t actually intend on it. So we still feel lucky."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jungkook.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He continues, "I think we're gaining some attention and getting some fans based in America. It's happening gradually, going up really slow, so I think we could expect more for the future. It's happening, and I hope that it's not just a happy accident. We have to keep up with the work."</p><p>Given their success in the US, the group was asked how they planned on building momentum. Monster explained that keeping a cool head was the best way to go about it.</p><p>"To capitalize on this, we have to not lose our minds. That's how we capitalize on this. Because we don't want to be so happy for this that we release an English song. Those things are really great, but we have to keep up with what we're doing. Getting ready for our next album. And, of course, we'll be coming back to America, I think more often because we're getting positive attention."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Without a doubt, the group had the right mindset.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZratdpbKzss6rpJqmk5p6sLqMrZ%2BeZZyWwaZ50qGmsGWnnsGpedKtnKmglaN6pLvLm5yrrF2ivLTAjLCYrZuYmrFuu81msKitpKqvpns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
