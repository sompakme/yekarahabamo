However, the courtship ended up being short-lived, as the pair had already parted ways by April of 2018. The two were later spotted (separately) at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Fest&nbsp;but seemed uninterested in sparking an old flame.</p><h2 id=reggie-bush>Reggie Bush</h2><p>After an outstanding college career at USC, running back Reggie Bush was selected 2nd overall in the 2006 NFL Draft.

However, the relationship was seemingly over before it even got started. The former NCAA champ and the reality starlet’s courtship only lasted about a month. Soon after, Kardashian would be romantically linked to another NBA star and embarked upon a relationship that lasted significantly longer.</p><h2 id=ben-simmons>Ben Simmons</h2><p>LSU’s Ben Simmons was the 1st overall pick in the 2016 NBA Draft.

The couple began dating in 2010, and their relationship was featured prominently on Keeping Up with the Kardashians. They would go on to wed. However, Kim K filed for divorce just 72 days after walking the aisle.

As a result, the relationship ended the same year it began.</p><h2 id=cristiano-ronaldo>Cristiano Ronaldo</h2><p>As our list has shown, the Kardashian girls clearly have a thing for NBA players. That being said, they have also been known to canoodle with stars from other sports. One such athlete was Cristiano Ronaldo, who is widely regarded as one of the greatest soccer players of all-time. The Portuguese standout is one of the most prolific goal scorers of his generation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following her breakup with Reggie Bush, <a href=#>Kim K</a> had a short-lived romance with the soccer star back in 2010.
