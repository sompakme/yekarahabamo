Hill completed three passes for 55 yards during the 2019 regular season. On top of that, he had 156 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown&nbsp;to go along with 19 receptions for 234 yards and six receiving touchdowns.</p><p>Starting quarterback Drew Brees signed a two-year extension worth $50 million, but the future Hall of Famer has been taking it one year at a time. The Saints are seemingly planning for Hill to take over the reigns once Brees retires.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brees and the Saints won their third straight NFC South division crown in 2019, but they were upset by the Minnesota Vikings in overtime of the Wild Card Round.

This would help keep Brees fresh and healthy as he tries to bring home one more Super Bowl to New Orleans before he retires.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hill still hasn't started any NFL games, and Winston might only spend the one season in New Orleans.
