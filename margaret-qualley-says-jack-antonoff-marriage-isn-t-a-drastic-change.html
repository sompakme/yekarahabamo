I’m glad the law is involved,” she teased.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The two have<i> </i>been nearly inseparable since tying the knot last summer, from <a href=#>cuddling up</a> at the 2024 Grammy Awards to <a href=#>collaborating on the music video</a> for Antonoff’s band Bleachers’ single “Tiny Moves.” Qualley codirected the video, which shows her dancing in front of the New York City skyline.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Margaret-Qualley-Says-She-Loves-The-Security-of-Marriage-to-Jack-Antonoff.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>It’s clear Qualley’s love for Antonoff runs deep as she shamelessly confessed to <i>Elle UK </i>that she knew right away he was The One for her.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>She had the realization while gushing about Antonoff to Chanel’s creative director <strong>Virginie Viard</strong> during a fitting for a <a href=#>haute couture show.</a></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I’d met Jack probably two weeks before, but I was head-over-heels in love right away. I had a sure, knowing feeling that he was my husband,” she recalled to the outlet.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Ironically, Viard had been fitting her for the show’s final look, an ivory wedding gown paired with a polka dot veil and pillbox hat.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I was talking about Jack and said to her, ‘I think I’ve just met a man I’m going to marry. And, Virginie, if I’m right, will you make me my wedding dress?’” Qualley continued. “I said, ‘Give me two years …’”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>And two years was all she needed. Qualley did indeed wear the designer when she and Antonoff wed <a href=#>in front of close friends</a> like <strong>Taylor Swift,</strong> <strong>Lana Del Rey</strong>, and <strong>Zoë Kravitz</strong>, walking down the aisle in an ivory slip dress with a plunging neckline.</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I’ve always wanted to be married,” the <i>Drive-Away Dolls </i>actress swooned. “I was that girly girl who would be on a walk with my sister fantasizing about our weddings, or what our husbands would be like.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Still, Antonoff was the inspiration behind their big lavish wedding, she said.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“He’s got so many great friends and a huge family, too,” Qualley explained. “I think [weddings] are almost as much for your family and your friends as it is for you. It was sweet and special and just the most magical day of my life.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGammaKcrrOx02aorpmcobK6edKasKxlmpawrHnAp6uopp%2Bbs265wKupopmXmnqqv82tZJpllKeutMDInGScoJGjtKZ7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
