But I would like someone for companionship, fun.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p dir=ltr>Speaking to Us Weekly exclusively in May 2019, Hurley revealed that she has <a href=#>decided to keep the details of her personal life under wraps</a>. “I made a vow a few years ago to keep quiet about my private life for a bit,” she said at the time. “I decided I talk too much about it in the past!
