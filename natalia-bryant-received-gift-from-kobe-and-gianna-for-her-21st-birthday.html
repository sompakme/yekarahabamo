She also rang in her milestone birthday with a star-studded bash attended by <strong>Kelly Rowland</strong>, <strong>Winnie Harlow</strong>, <strong>Ciara</strong>, <strong>Russell Wilson</strong> and more.</p><p>“Happy birthday 21st birthday @nataliabryant!!!

The <a href=#>other seven victims</a> included the pilot, members of Gianna’s basketball team and their parents and her basketball coach.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Natalie-Bryant-Received-a-Gift-Sent-on-Behalf-of-Late-Dad-Kobe-and-Sister-Gianna-for-Her-21st-Birthday-120.jpg><p>“We are completely devastated by the sudden loss of my adoring husband, Kobe — the amazing father of our children; and my beautiful, sweet Gianna — a loving, thoughtful, and wonderful daughter, and amazing sister to Natalia, Bianka, and Capri,” Vanessa wrote in an <a href=#>Instagram message</a> shared days after their death.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Natalie-Bryant-Received-a-Gift-Sent-on-Behalf-of-Late-Dad-Kobe-and-Sister-Gianna-for-Her-21st-Birthday-117.jpg><p>She concluded her heartfelt post by writing: “Our love for them is endless — and that’s to say, immeasurable. I just wish I could hug them, kiss them and bless them. Have them here with us, forever. Thank you for sharing your joy, your grief and your support with us. We ask that you grant us the respect and privacy we will need to navigate this new reality.”</p><p>After the heartbreaking accident, Vanessa filed and settled a <a href=#>wrongful death lawsuit</a> against Island Express Helicopters.

All my jerseys said ‘Slim’ — I didn’t grow into the jerseys until I was older, so my dad always called me ‘Slim.’”</p><p>Natalia also showed off the gold medallion she wears honoring her family’s Mamba and Mambacita Sports Foundation, which celebrates Kobe and Gianna’s legacies by funding underprivileged athletes. “[The engraving] says ‘Dedication makes dreams come true,’” she shared.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGanmaSWuaqtjJupspmeqXqzscKeoK%2BdlGK0qrLTZp2rp51iuLCuxGaYp5xdnLaius2aZJ%2BnomK1pr6Ma2isrF2XtrPAx52Ysmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
