He was also criticized for later posting a video to his YouTube channel about Lara Croft.</p><p>A TJ-starring video posted online in late 2011 was dubbed “very intimate” and “disgusting.” In the video, TJ appeared with a banana, chocolate syrup, and coffee. In BANANAGATE 2011, The Amazing Atheist gave the video an apathetic response. A second “very personal” film, including hot oil, was also posted online.</p><p>When the perpetrator of the Trollhättan school attack was discovered to be a follower of Kirk and other such YouTubers in 2015, he was also highlighted in press reports at that time.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-tj-kirks-wife></span>Who Is Tj Kirk’s Wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Thomas James “TJ” Kirk III is married to his wife,<strong>&nbsp;Chelsea Theimp.</strong></p><p>She is active on her Instagram account with the username&nbsp;@chelsea_theimp.</p><p>On August 11, 2018, Tj announced that he was getting married to her through his Instagram post.
