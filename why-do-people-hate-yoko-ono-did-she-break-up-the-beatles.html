Did She Break Up The Beatles?</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>You would think it is impossible to hate a woman whose name literally means “Moon Child” but you would be wrong. Yoko Ono has so many accolades to her name that should make the whole world be irrevocably in love with her. She has been awarded a lifetime achievement Golden Lion Award as well as the Dr. Rainer Hildebrandt Human Rights Award. But despite this, quite a number of people still harbor hate and resentment towards her as she has been accused of being the reason why the legendary music group, The Beatles, broke up.</p><p>In case you are still wondering who she is, Yoko Ono is a Japanese singer, songwriter, multimedia artist, and peace activist who is also known for being the wife of John Lennon, a founding member of the Beatles, who he was murdered in 1980. Her genres of music include avant-garde, experimental, rock, pop, electronic, and downtown. In this article, we explore the life of Yoko and offer an explanation for why people hate and accuse her of breaking up the legendary music group.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=biography-and-early-life></span> <strong>Biography and </strong><strong>Early Life</strong><br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Yoko Ono was born on the 18th of February 1933 in the city of Tokyo, Japan. She was born to a mother named Isoko Ono and a father named Eisuke Ono. Her mother worked as a banker and was very successful while her father was a professional classical pianist. Interestingly, Yoko did not meet her father until she was two years old as he had been transferred to San Francisco by his employer just before she was born.</p><p>Yoko Ono’s education started with piano lessons at the tender age of 4. She went on to attend a very exclusive school called Gakushuin which is also called the Peers School. When her family moved to New York City, her education stopped for a while until they returned to Japan, where she was transferred to a Christian school called Keimei Gakuen. Yoko witnessed World War II and her family remained in Tokyo sheltered in a special bunker.</p><p>The war was tough and Yoko recounts that at some point, her family had to beg for food while their belongings sat in a wheelbarrow. By April 1946, Yoko was able to go back to school at Gakushuin as the school had been untouched by the war. She was classmates with Prince Akihito who eventually became the emperor of Japan.</p><p>After her graduation in 1951, Yoko gained admission to study Philosophy (as the first woman ever to enter the department) at Gakushuin University. However, after only two semesters, she dropped out of school.</p><p><b>See Also:&nbsp;Seven Things You Didn’t Know About Zach Herron And His Rise To Fame</b></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-do-people-hate-yoko-ono></span><strong>Why Do People Hate Yoko Ono?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As mentioned earlier, Yoko Ono is known for being the wife of singer John Lennon of the Beatles. She first interacted with a member of The Beatles when she visited Paul McCartney at his house located in London in the hopes of obtaining a Lennon–McCartney song manuscript. While she didn’t get what she wanted from Paul McCartney, Lennon gave her the original handwritten lyrics to the song The Word. Fast forward to the 9th of November 1966, Yoko and Lennon met officially at the Indica Gallery in London and immediately hit it off.</p><p>At that time, Lennon was married but still got suspiciously close to Yoko. When his wife Cynthia accosted him, he said their relationship was strictly professional as she was trying to obtain a grant. They began their relationship while Lennon’s wife was away in Greece on holiday. A short while later, Lennon and Cynthia got divorced while Yoko became pregnant with their first child.&nbsp; In 1970, the Beatles disbanded and rumors started flying that it was Yoko who came in between them.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=did-yoko-ono-break-up-the-beatles></span><strong>Did Yoko Ono Break Up The Beatles?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Several factors were responsible for The Beatles breaking up. Their manager, Brian Epstein passed away, and it was a great loss. The Beatles weren’t able to replace Epstein’s managerial skills, and the band suffered heavily because of the void left behind. Another factor was that, of the four members of the band, three were talented songwriters. Friction began to rise when song ideas got rejected because each writer wanted more writing credit.</p><p>So to answer the question, even though Yoko Ono’s relationship with the other band members was strained, she was not a direct cause of the band’s breakup as the group’s members had already been feuding for a while.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYrnqlu4ypnKionJp6qa3TnmSyp5ukerC6zmabopxdqLWmecGrnJqjXaq9bsDHnmSbnZGpuaa%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
