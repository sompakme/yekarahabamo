After all, Van Dien is blessed with supreme good looks which make him perfect for the kind of matinee idol roles that were all the rage in years past. Partially due to those good looks, many people believed that Van Dien was set to be the next big thing at Hollywood at one time in the past.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Nasim Pedrad Keeps Her Personal Life So Private</a></span></p><p>While <a href=#>some stars who are thought to be the next big thing in Hollywood rise to the task</a>, others fall far short of expectations. Unfortunately for Casper Van Dien, he wound up in the latter group since he never rose to a level where he could be called a major movie star. Still, Van Dien once enjoyed enough fame that people all over the world remember the actor fondly to this day. However, most of the people who remember Van Dien best for his past success have no idea that his personal life has gone through so much drama in the last several years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=casper-van-dien-rsquo-s-rise-to-fame-and-fall-from-grace>Casper Van Dien’s Rise To Fame And Fall From Grace</h2><p>In between the years 1987 and 1995, Paul Verhoeven helmed the movies RoboCop, Total Recall, and Basic Instinct. Even though <a href=#>Sharon Stone has since accused Verhoeven of egregiously misleading her</a> while making Basic Instinct, the success of all those films made him very powerful. As a result, when it was announced that Verhoeven was set to direct a movie called Starship Troopers, many people had high expectations for the film. With that in mind, it should go without saying that it was a very big deal when Casper Van Dien was cast as Starship Troopers’ main character Johnny Rico.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Was Sharon Stone Paid For 'Basic Instinct'?</a></span></p><p>Around the same time that Casper Van Dien was cast as Starship Trooper’s lead character, it was announced that he was set to portray the legendary figure, Tarzan. Van Dien also landed a noteworthy role in Tim Burton’s Sleepy Hollow. Even though most people don’t consider Sleepy Hollow to be one of <a href=#>Burton’s best movies</a>, it was a big deal that Van Dien got to work with the famous director. Furthermore, landing a series of roles like that in short order is the kind of thing that any actor dreams of.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Canceled Tim Burton Movies That Could Have Been Broke The Bank At The Box Offic</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately for Casper Van Dien, Starship Troopers was widely panned when it came out and it underperformed at the box office. Worse yet, critics and audiences alike couldn’t stand Van Dien’s Tarzan and the Lost City so it completely flopped at the box office. When it comes to Sleepy Hollow, it did solid business but virtually nobody credited Van Dien with its success. For all of those reasons, Van Dien’s once-promising career quickly floundered and he has starred in smaller projects ever since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=casper-van-dien-rsquo-s-personal-life-has-been-extremely-messy>Casper Van Dien’s Personal Life Has Been Extremely Messy</h2><p>When Casper Van Dien and the cast and crew of Starship Troopers were working on the film, they should have been able to rest assured they would remain unscathed. Unfortunately for Van Dien, however, he suffered a serious injury when a stunt went wrong. When Van Dien filmed a scene where his character was set to jump off a “tanker bug”, the actor suffered three cracked ribs. Worse yet, Van Dien also had internal injuries which were serious enough that he wound up coughing blood.</p><p>Unfortunately for Casper Van Dien, the worst things that have happened in his life were so bad that they could easily trigger anyone who reads about them. For that reason, anyone who is sensitive to reading about self-harm or abuse should stop here.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the mid-2000s, Casper Van Dien and his then-wife Catherine Oxenberg revealed in a CNN interview that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he’d been sexually abused when he was an eight-year-old child</a>. With that in mind, it makes perfect sense that in 2009 Van Dien starred as his Starship Troopers character in a PSA about childhood abuse. Amazingly enough, that wasn’t the first time that Van Dien and Oxenberg were the subjects of headlines that were related to abuse. After all, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it was reported that Van Dien was arrested for physically abusing Oxenberg</a> in 2002. That said, it is worth noting that the only notable outlet that reported on the supposed incident was The National Enquirer and all of their stories should be taken with a grain of salt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2012, Casper Van Dien had to deal with a situation that is any parent’s nightmare when his son who has the same name as him tried to take his own life. Fortunately, even though <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Van Dien’s son was found unresponsive</a>, he would ultimately survive and to date, there is no indication that anything similar has happened. Hopefully, Van Dien’s son is happy and healthy today and the entire family has dealt with the trauma of something like that in the best way possible for them.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Who Is 'Stranger Things' Season 4 Star Grace Van Dien?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiamqugmr9uwsCnZJ2hlaN6uLTArWShmaClsq%2Bxw2aqnJmema6tew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
