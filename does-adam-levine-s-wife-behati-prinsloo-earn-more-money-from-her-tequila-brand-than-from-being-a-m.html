Her husband Adam Levine may be rich thanks to the band's success, but she has done well for herself. Since Prinsloo used to be a Victoria's Secret model, she earned a high salary for many years. Some <a href=#>Victoria's Secret Angels are still wealthy</a> today and that includes Prinsloo. Now, she has a tequila brand called Calirosa. She seems to have put her heart and soul into it. The brand seems to have become popular and the company's Instagram account has almost 43,000 followers.</p><p>Does Behati Prinsloo actually make a lot of money from Calirosa?

It was his idea with his wife and they were willing to fund the idea — not just say ‘we’re celebrities, we have an idea, let’s go find someone else’s money to do it,’ which is, I think, a very unique situation for us. I think it shows the belief in the product and puts him in a different category than most celebrities that are involved in brands."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gimpelson continued to Forcebrands.com, "What separates us apart from a lot of celebrity brands is that they are actually putting their money where their mouth is.

Each type has a specific description on the website. The description of Rosa Blanco says, "Calirosa’s standout hue, finish, and flavor are on full display from first look to final sip.

And it's a brand that means a lot to Adam Levine and his wife Behati Prinsloo. As she explained in an interview with Travel and Leisure in 2021, she and her husband love going to Mexico for vacations. She said that they took a trip to celebrate when she turned 30 and they also had their wedding in Mexico. And when they found pink tequila, they knew that it was a great business idea.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Is Adam Levine Like As A Dad?</a></span>As Behati Prinsloo told Morning Honey, it's fun to focus on a business like Calirosa because it's so different from her work as a model.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She explained, "It was really cool for us to have 100 percent creative control over a brand that we started from the ground up. Coming from a modeling background, I never had full control over anything. And Adam obviously has a bit more control in his career, but he is in a band, so he and his bandmates always have to agree on everything together."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/behati-prinsloo.jpg><p>Prinsloo told Morning Honey that she and her husband have a good professional relationship because they balance each other out.
