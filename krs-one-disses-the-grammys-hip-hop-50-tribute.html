And reason being is because I know people don’t understand this — and I say this respectfully. KRS-One is a Hip-Hop extremist. I’m not violent, a violent extremist. I’m insane with this culture. I know I must have lost my mind in this.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-965855278.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The <a href=#>Boogie Down Productions co-founder </a>also pointed to the perceived exploitation of Hip-Hop culture as another factor that made him averse to accepting his fellow rap legend’s offer. “I don’t fight it, I don’t apologize for it. I recognize that my experience in this thing called Hip-Hop is different from mostly everybody else’s experience with Hip-Hop… I restrict myself in a certain way, because I know who I am in this culture. You’re in the temple of Hip Hop, this is our home. This place, this institution can never side with, come under, understand the exploitation of our culture. Never will you ever see me standing in the environment where our culture is being exploited.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The Bronx, N.Y. native then blasted the Grammys, highlighting their hesitance to fully embrace and celebrate Hip-Hop culture and rap artists throughout the years. “So when I got the call, I immediately said nah. First of all, it’s the Grammys? You get no respect here. None. Now we respect your existence, we know you exist. And we know that you’re the Grammys and we understand that and we respect that. But you ignored Hip Hop for 49 years. At the 50th year, you wanna call us? You couldn’t even call on 47 and gear it up to 50. You wait to the 50th year to call Hip-Hop’s authentic teacha? Nah, you don’t get that privilege.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-1340830123.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">KRS-One is one of multiple rap legends who have taken issue with the various Hip-Hop 50 celebrations over the past year. MC Hammer, who also declined to appear for the Grammys salute to Hip-Hop, is among the more notable artists whose lack of visibility has been highlighted, with Mistah F.A.B. speaking out on his fellow Oakland native’s behalf.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I’m watching this 50th year anniversary, right, and I’m like, ‘How do y’all not have MC Hammer on a bill?” F.A.B.<a href=#> asked in August</a>. “How do you not have rap’s first megastar on a bill somewhere, coming out doing at least ‘2 Legit 2 Quit’ or something. You don’t got MC Hammer included in that?’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6C%2FtHmQZpuiq6OawG6z0ZqkprGjYrWqvIyhpqllZWV6tb7Im6ytnV1mf3SAl2xpamtiZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
