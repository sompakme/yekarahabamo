Millions of people all over the planet have love lives with high and low moments, and yet there's just something about two celebrities dating that makes it tough to ignore. This explains why <a href=#>so many people everywhere stopped what they were doing back in late 2012 and turned their attention to a particular American pop/country star and a rising British pop singer</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We're talking (of course!) about <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> and Harry Styles!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Songs Taylor Swift Wrote About Her Boyfriend Joe Alwyn</a></span></p><p>Whether you're pro-Haylor or not, the relationship definitely had an impact. Taylor and Harry only lasted a few months, but they seemed to be very into each other the whole time. With multiple tour dates, trips and star-studded parties between them, it's easy to say that they experienced a lot more together in those few months than a lot of people do in a lifetime.</p><p>It took years for either Taylor or Harry to talk about their experience, and we're still learning things about their time together now, seven years later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Updated on January 11, 2022: </strong>In 2021, Taylor Swift and Harry Styles both attended the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, where Swift won the Grammy for Album of the Year and Styles won for Best Pop Solo Performance. The two stars were spotted chatting with one another at the ceremony, and <a href=#>fans were thrilled to see the two singers interact so many years after calling off their relationship</a>. Both Swift and Styles are now happily dating other people – Taylor Swift has been dating actor Joe Alwyn since they met in 2016, and Harry Styles has been dating actress and director Olivia Wilde since he starred in her film Don't Worry Darling – and it seems like the two pop stars are now on friendly terms with one another.</p><h2 id=harry-styles-and-taylor-swift-both-called-the-relationship-lsquo-a-learning-experience-rsquo><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>Harry Styles And Taylor Swift Both Called The Relationship ‘A Learning Experience’</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though their time together was short, it seems to have been memorable for both parties. Four years after their breakup, Harry Styles told Rolling Stone, in an interview, that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the relationship was both “hard” and a “learning experience”</a>. Taylor Swift seems to agree, as she expressed the same sentiments in a Billboard interview in 2017.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-rsquo-s-song-lyrics-tell-how-she-really-felt><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>Taylor Swift’s Song Lyrics Tell How She Really Felt</span></h2><p>As she has with most of her past relationships, Taylor wrote a song or two about her time with Harry. While she seems to have written multiple songs about Styles, there’s one in particular that really stands out.</p><p>Swift told Rolling Stone that the song “Out of the Woods” on her album 1989<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was inspired by a relationship where, “every day was a struggle. Forget making plans for life. We were just trying to make it to next week.”</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=harry-styles-and-taylor-swift-took-numerous-trips-together><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>Harry Styles And Taylor Swift Took Numerous Trips Together</span></h2><p>Even though their relationship only lasted a few months, they were spotted on numerous vacations and work trips together. From various locations around the U.K. and New York City to Los Angeles, Utah, the Caribbean and a multitude of spots in between, the pair practically toured the world side by side.</p><h2 id=harry-styles-and-taylor-swift-were-in-a-snowmobile-crash-together><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Harry Styles And Taylor Swift Were In A Snowmobile Crash Together</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor's “Out of the Woods” song also hints at the two being in an accident together, which was later revealed to have happened in real life: “Remember when you hit the brakes too soon. Twenty stitches in a hospital room,” the song goes.</p><p>Those stitches really happened as a result of a snowmobile crash the two were involved in, on a ski trip in Utah. Harry was hurt more than Taylor and needed stitches.</p><h2 id=harry-styles-predicted-the-songs-taylor-swift-would-write-about-him><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Harry Styles Predicted The Songs Taylor Swift Would Write About Him</span></h2><p>Months after his breakup with Taylor, Harry Styles was interviewed by Us Weekly. When asked about the failed relationship, he actually predicted that Taylor would write a song about him. However, he also said that it would be “hypocritical” to try and stop her since musical artists tend to write what they know.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=harry-styles-also-wrote-a-song-about-taylor-swift><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Harry Styles Also Wrote A Song About Taylor Swift</span></h2><p>It’s not often that Taylor Swift’s exes write their own songs about their relationships with her, but that’s exactly what Harry Styles did. Released on his debut solo album, following Taylor’s songs, “Two Ghosts” is said to be about Taylor. Many fans also believe that his song “Ever Since New York” is also about her.</p><h2 id=harry-styles-was-embarrassed-by-their-quick-breakup><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Harry Styles Was Embarrassed By Their Quick Breakup</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perez Hilton first broke the news of the music power couple’s breakup in January of 2013. Hilton also cited a source allegedly close to Harry Styles, who said that the singer had been cautioned about the relationship for a while... actually, since its inception. As a result, he felt “a little foolish” about the fact that it ended after only a few months.</p><h2 id=harry-styles-and-taylor-swift-were-introduced-by-ed-sheeran><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Harry Styles And Taylor Swift Were Introduced By Ed Sheeran</span></h2><p>According to Rolling Stone, Taylor Swift and Harry Styles were first introduced to one another through their mutual friend, fellow star and singer/songwriter, Ed Sheeran. Both are reportedly still friends with Sheeran.</p><p>So far, it doesn't seem like Sheeran has played matchmaker again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=harry-styles-was-only-18-years-old-when-they-dated><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Harry Styles Was Only 18 Years Old When They Dated</span></h2><p>While Taylor was in her 20s during her time with Harry, it may shock some fans to know that Harry was only 18 years old! However, the couple allegedly met for the first time after Harry’s birthday, so he technically never knew the singer while he was underage.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-didn-rsquo-t-date-for-a-while-after-their-breakup><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Taylor Swift Didn’t Date For A While After Their Breakup</span></h2><p>When they broke up in early 2013, Taylor was vocal about her desire to not date anyone for some time afterward. And it turns out, she followed through. According to a detailed Taylor Swift relationship timeline published by Billboard, the singer didn’t date anyone until Calvin Harris in 2015.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does Scooter Braun Own The Rights To Taylor Swift’s ‘Folklore’ Album?</a></span></p><h2 id=taylor-swift-rsquo-s-longest-relationships-came-directly-after-harry-styles><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Taylor Swift’s Longest Relationships Came Directly After Harry Styles</span></h2><p>Interestingly, the same timeline reveals that all of Taylor Swift’s nine relationships before Harry (and including Harry) lasted only a few months (if that). However, Swift’s first relationship after Harry (with Calvin Harris) lasted over a year, from February 2015 to June 2016. She is currently in a surprisingly private relationship with actor Joe Alwyn that has lasted since 2016.</p><h2 id=harry-styles-has-had-an-equally-full-relationship-history><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Harry Styles Has Had An Equally Full Relationship History</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many people have given Taylor Swift a lot of flack over the years for her numerous boyfriends and often-brief relationships. However, Harry Styles has a similar love life. According to his relationship timeline in Seventeen, he had several relationships before Taylor that also only lasted a few months. Most of his relationships since have also run short, including his on-again, off-again relationship with Kendall Jenner. His year-long relationship with Olivia Wilde might just be his longest to date.</p><h2 id=harry-styles-rsquo-s-rebound-was-nicole-scherzinger><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Harry Styles’s Rebound Was Nicole Scherzinger</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For anyone who raises an eyebrow at Taylor being older than Harry, that’s nothing compared to who he dated in the months after their breakup. His rebound relationship was with former Pussycat Dolls lead singer, Nicole Scherzinger, who was 35 at the time, compared to Harry who was not yet 20 years old.</p><h2 id=gigi-hadid-may-have-snubbed-harry-styles-as-a-result-of-the-breakup><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Gigi Hadid May Have Snubbed Harry Styles As A Result of the Breakup</span></h2><p>Model Gigi Hadid is known to be a good friend of Taylor’s, as well as close with another Harry Styles ex, Kendall Jenner. At the time, some people believed this is why she appeared to rebuff and ignore him while the two of them were attending the American Music Awards in 2015. However, the truth may be that she was ignoring Styles because she had just started dating his ex-bandmate Zayn Malik, and perhaps there was some bad blood between Harry and Zayn at that time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=harry-styles-decided-to-release-his-latest-album-on-taylor-swift-rsquo-s-birthday><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Harry Styles Decided To Release His Latest Album On Taylor Swift’s Birthday</span></h2><p>When Harry’s second studio album, Fine Line, was first announced, most people didn’t realize the significance of the release date. It was set to come out on December 13 (this is Taylor Swift’s birthday...even more significantly, her 30th birthday). Considering the pair dated during December 2012, it’s safe to say her B-day is within Harry’s knowledge.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why Fans Debate What Taylor Swift's Song "Cardigan" Means</a></span></p><h2 id=harry-styles-gave-taylor-swift-cupcakes-for-her-birthday><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Harry Styles Gave Taylor Swift Cupcakes For Her Birthday</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Turns out Harry definitely knew when Taylor’s birthday was because he got her a gift of custom-made cupcakes from a bakery in Warrington, England. According to the Daily Mail, he got her 23 uniquely designed cupcakes for her 23rd birthday. How sweet!</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-got-harry-styles-an-even-more-thoughtful-birthday-gift><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Taylor Swift Got Harry Styles An Even More Thoughtful Birthday Gift</span></h2><p>For Harry’s own birthday in February, Taylor got him his own gift. Only hers had a little more thought put into it. Knowing Harry had a tattoo of song lyrics from the Australian band The Temper Trap, Taylor asked the band’s drummer if he could produce a handwritten version just for Harry.</p><p>Most reports say that the couple broke up before she could give it to him, though, and it's unclear if he ever got it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-secretly-knew-harry-styles-rsquo-s-tattoo-was-written-incorrectly><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Taylor Swift Secretly Knew Harry Styles’s Tattoo Was Written Incorrectly</span></h2><p>Speaking of the song lyrics Taylor got for Harry, it turns out Harry’s tattoo version is incorrect. According to the U.K.’s Daily Star, he never realized they were wrong until Taylor pointed it out. Even then, he didn’t believe her until she approached the band members at the ARIA Awards in November 2012. Afterward, he swore Taylor to secrecy!</p><h2 id=harry-styles-and-taylor-swift-used-to-share-a-necklace><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Harry Styles And Taylor Swift Used To Share A Necklace</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Harry and Taylor have been spotted multiple times, on separate occasions, wearing the same paper plane necklace. In fact, it’s one of the things that made people start to speculate that they were dating in the first place. According to Taylor’s song lyrics and a lot of photo evidence, the necklace actually belongs to Harry.</p><h2 id=harry-styles-has-an-enduring-love-for-taylor-swift-rsquo-s-music><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Harry Styles Has An Enduring Love For Taylor Swift’s Music</span></h2><p>They may no longer be an item, but that doesn’t mean they can’t appreciate each other’s work. During a concert in 2018, Harry even sang a portion of Taylor’s lyrics to “22” to his audience. Now that plenty of time has passed, it seems that the two have grown and that there are no hard feelings!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>What Really Happened Between Taylor Swift And Taylor Lautner?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lmJa%2Fs8WMrKuypJWoerOxy5qroqeeqLWqvIyhmLKkn6d6sMHTZqafZaSdsm7DzqibrGWkrLxus8eoqq2rXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
