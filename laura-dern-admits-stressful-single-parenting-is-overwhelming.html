I have never had anybody else bully me in my single parenting life. I am lucky to have champions around me, but I can definitely do it myself.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Big Little Lies </a>star gave birth to Ellery, 18, in 2001, and Jaya, 14, arrived three years later.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Laura-Dern-On-Single-Parenthood-Modern-Luxury-02.jpg><p>Since her <a href=#>2013 divorce</a>, Harper, 49, and his wife, <strong>Jaclyn Matfus</strong>, have <a href=#>welcomed a son</a> of their own named Besso. The musician also shares Charles and Harper with his first wife, <strong>Joanna Harper</strong>.</p><p>In May, the Emmy winner shared the surprising benefits of single motherhood. “This is the first time in my life that I am being ambitious because I am a single parent,” the Los Angeles native told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">InStyle</a> at the time. “Raising kids gave me enough street cred to feel like I deserved the right to make money. This moment in my life is so sexy and freeing because I’ve had many relationships, I’ve had a marriage, I have my amazing children, so I’m not hiding who I am to get somebody who is willing to have kids or be married.”</p><p>She added, “The more I learn about my mistakes as a mother, the deeper I enjoy how fully I love my children. Because I can let them know I really screw up sometimes. I hide from blame in a lot of areas in my life, but I’m trying not to do that as a mom.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGalmaWnrm6wxKulZpmUora1v4ysq6udo6iztriMrKCnn5yaerGt0Z6lraGenHqqv4yorZ6qp52yrbnIp55o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
