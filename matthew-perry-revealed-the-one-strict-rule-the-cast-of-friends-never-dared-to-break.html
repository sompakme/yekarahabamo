For some comedies, touching the script or making an adjustment is forbidden. However, that wasn't the case on Friends. The main six would watch the show back together and give each other tips on how they could adjust. In addition, what was written in the script didn't necessarily mean that was going to make the final cut.</p><p>The cast would feel it out and if a change needed to be made at the last second to better a scene, they were definitely going to do that. At the end of the way, it was all about getting a positive reaction from the audience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/rachel-friends.png><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Late Friends Star James Michael Tyler Had A Heartbreaking Reaction To His Medical Diagnosis Before His Death</a></span></p><p>In terms of unscripted moments, the show saw plenty.
