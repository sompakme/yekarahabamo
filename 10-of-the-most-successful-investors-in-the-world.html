Hearing about bosses or friends who do really well in the market can put dollar signs in our eyes, motivating us to move forward with our own investment portfolios. But success in investing can sometimes be short-lived. It is easy for individuals to be successful in a bull market, but it is hard for individuals to be successful in a bear market. It is even more difficult for individuals to be successful investors when there is a crash.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, there are a few superstars out there who make it look downright easy. They weather, or even thrive in, the storms of the market. These individuals are praised in the business world and the media alike. Individuals will try to emulate their stock picks in order to have great results themselves. They will soon find that it is not as easy as it looks to just copy a genius. These investors truly stand in a class of their own when it comes to their actions in the stock market.</p><p>Just like in the NBA or PGA, there are those who are the very best in the entire world. To call yourself the best in the world in anything is a great feat, but to be one of the best investors in the world is a whole different game all together. Individuals who are counted among the best investors in the world not only have massive amounts of money for themselves, but also dictate what happens in so much of the stock market.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So many individuals follow these investing gods’ moves that they can find even small maneuvers making huge ripples, creating huge fluctuations in the price of certain stocks or industries. Here is a list of 1o of the most successful investors in the world.</p><h2 id=edward-johnson-iii---9-3-billiion>10. Edward Johnson, III - $9.3 Billiion</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pretty much everyone has heard of Fidelity investments, and<a title="Edward Johnson Net Worth" href=#> Edward Johnson III</a> is responsible for running this company (with some help from his daughter). Fidelity Investments was started by Johnson's father, and he worked his way up in that company from an entry level research analyst position all the way up to president of the entire company.</p><p>Without Johnson we may not have the discount brokerage market that we have today. He pioneered this discount brokerage market and brought it to smaller investors, banks, insurance companies, and more. Now Fidelity Investments is one of the biggest and most accessible discount brokerage firms in the world, and Edward Johnson III is a man of considerable wealth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=suleiman-kerimov---7-1-billion>9. Suleiman Kerimov - $7.1 Billion</h2><p>The story of <a title="Suleiman Kerimov Net Worth" href=#>Suleiman Kerimov's</a> success is pretty inspirational one. When he was first starting out his career, he worked as an accountant for an electrical plant that made semi conductors and other parts used for circuit boards. He was only making 250 dollars a month, so he and his wife had to live at the workers’ hostel attached to the plant.</p><p>When Kerimov made the leap into banking, he found his investment growing quite rapidly.
