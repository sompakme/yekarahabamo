Currently, his wealth is estimated at $320 billion. That puts him miles above the world's second-richest person Jeff Bezos, who's behind more than $100 billion. Of Musk's wealth, just under $200 billion of his fortune has been acclimated from Tesla stocks. Roughly <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">twelve percent of his wealth</a> is made up of private assets, with the remainder coming from miscellaneous ventures.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tesla scored big time in market capitalization when rental company Hertz revealed that they were purchasing upwards of 100,00 of the manufacturer's electric cars. Along with giving Tesla $4.2 billion, this greatly impacted the company's shares. According to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>, Tesla saw a $1.2 trillion market cap after shares closed at record-breaking $1,208 on Monday.</p><p>Just days after Musk reached his <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">historical milestone</a>, he put out a rather abrasive challenge toward the director of the World Food Programme. Researcher Dr. Eli David responded to a <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN </a>headline that stated that just 2% of Musk's wealth could stop world hunger.</p><p>"Fact check: 2% of @elonmusk's wealth is $6B," Dr. David tweets, "In 2020 the UN World Food Program (WFP) raised $8.4B. How come it didn't solve world hunger?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Musk boldly responded, saying he'd be more than willing to sell Tesla's stock as long as the World Food Programme could explain within the Twitter thread how two percent of his wealth could solve world hunger. He also presented the caveat that it would have to be done through "open source accounting, so the public sees precisely how the money is spent."</p><p>World Food Programme's director David Beasley quickly chimed in. He pointed out that, while a small portion of Musk's wealth would not end world hunger entirely, the funds could greatly alleviate a plethora of global issues.</p><p>"$6B will not solve world hunger, but it WILL prevent geopolitical instability, mass migration and save 42 million people on the brink of starvation," the director quote-tweeted Musk, "an unprecedented crisis and a perfect storm due to Covid-19/conflict/climate crisis."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In response, Musk asked Beasley to publish WFP's current & proposed spending so that the public can be aware of the exact initiatives that funds are being distributed into.</p><p>Back in 2012, when his net worth sat at only $2 billion, Musk signed a pledge to donate half of his fortune to charitable organizations. As he continues to break new grounds of wealth, it may be in his hands that change can be brought about.</p><p><span class=next-single>Read Next: <a href=#>Billion-Dollar Charity: After Promising To Donate Half Of His Fortune, Here Is Elon Musk's Progress So Far</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Forbes,</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS News</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Today</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSyrbvNZqSuq5tir6avzqacrGWknbJussirqq1loJq%2FtLvNZqCnZZiewLW70bJkraddna63sYyaZKedpGLEsL7ToWSonl1ofXF5waKjpaGfo3w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
