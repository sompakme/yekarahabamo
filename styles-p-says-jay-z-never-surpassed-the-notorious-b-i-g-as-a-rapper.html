During an appearance on Scoop B Radio, the Yonkers rep broke down his reasoning behind picking Biggie as a superior artist to JAY-Z, suggesting that the latter wouldn’t be as successful if not for <a href=#>the former’s tragic death</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“No, I don’t, Styles said upon being asked of <a href=#>the two Brooklynites’</a> respectective rank in comparison to one another. “I don’t say anyone surpassed Biggie because Big didn’t have a fair shot to be around as long as he should’ve, and I believe <a href=#>he set the tone.</a>”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1390898553.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He continued, “I believe in Hip-Hop; we make too many comparisons, especially with people who are not around. I don’t think JAY-Z makes it to where he’s at; The L.O.X. makes it to where he’s at… a bunch of us, if it wasn’t for Big and ‘Pac setting a certain tone, standard and bar in the rap game for you to keep up to the bar.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">This isn’t the first time that Styles P has gushed over The Notorious B.I.G.’s creative excellence, as he’s listed him as <a href=#>his personal favorite rapper</a> of all-time on multiple occassions. In 2022, the renowned lyricist appeared on Creators Club alongside LOX spiier Jadakiss and broke down why Biggie was in a class his own.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I think most people understand him as the greatest MC to ever live,” the health advocate said at the time. “What makes him the greatest, he was really great in all aspects of rhyming. Most people are good in two categories, maybe three, if you’re pushing it. Big was really, really nice in all categories.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-74738091.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Styles also spoke to Biggie’s character outside of the booth, describing him as a welcoming individual that embraced those in his circumference, regardless of status. “What really topped it off was he was a charismatic individual, but he was very f**king classy and a G at the same time,” he said.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“He ain’t just treat me, Kiss and Louch good; he treated all over our homeboys good,” Styles added. “He would treat my man how he would treat me. He would give me that same drink, that same weed, that same thing, and I think that’s what set him apart for me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1509326990.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The 48-year-old continued, “I think he embodied something that most people don’t, and he was a student of the game. He loved rhyming, so when he heard us rhyme, and you know, at those times when somebody asked you to rhyme, you rhymed.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">See Styles P’s discussion with Scoop B below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6jBurjErGSpZZqWxm7GjKecr52iYsC2vs%2BaqqydlGKvqrPGopxmmaNiv6K8z56pZmliaIF5hJRsZ25n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
