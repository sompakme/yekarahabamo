The patriarch, John Lind, is an assistant director and the matriarch, Barbara Alyn Lind, is best-known for playing Deb Scott on One Tree Hill and roles on the Honey, I Shrunk The Kids TV show. But her three daughters have collectively eclipsed her career in Hollywood. The youngest, Alyvia, is best known for her work on the <a href=#>Netflix</a> series Daybreak and on the Chucky TV show. But it's her two older daughters who've been making a name for themselves.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Leighton Meester Finally Shares Her Thoughts About The 'Gossip Girl' Reboot</a></span></p><p>Both Natalie and Emily Alyn Lind have been capturing attention for their TV and movie work. <a href=#>Emily is easily best-known for her starring role</a> on the Gossip Girl revival series and Natalie led Fox's The Gifted before its cancelation. But due to their style, remarkable looks, and somewhat mysterious demeanors, both young women have built a huge social media following. Therefore, fans have become entranced in their personal lives, specifically who they're dating. But fans have noticed that both Natalie and Emily may have had a boyfriend in common...</p><h2 id=who-is-natalie-alyn-lind-dating>Who Is Natalie Alyn Lind Dating?</h2><p>It's extremely hard to know much about Emily Alyn Lind's romantic life as she's far more secretive about it than her older sister, Natalie. She doesn't post much about her love life and therefore fans rely on paparazzi shots. Natalie, on the other hand, has posted numerous pics with a variety of men over the years. She seems to have had a very active love life including dating a few men long-term... individually, of course.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Natalie Alyn Lind’s Relationship With her Famous Sisters</a></span></p><p><a href=#>Natalie Alyn Lind's love life changed in 2021</a>. For two years, she was dating actor Jordan Christian Hearn. The two would constantly post PDA-filled images on their social media. But that ended at the beginning of 2021.</p><p>Not long after, Natalie shared images of herself with many different men, most of which were clearly just her friends. But mortgage broker Scott C. Keller got a lot of attention. And then he didn't.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perhaps this is because Kai Caster took up a lot of her attention. For a while, it seemed as though Natalie and Kai were just very close friends. But the pair have all but confirmed their relationship. Their cozy photos and PDA seem to prove that they are, in fact, an item. But this has caused fans to raise their eyebrows as Kai was once said to be linked to Natalie's younger sister, Emily.</p><h2 id=who-is-kai-caster>Who Is Kai Caster?</h2><p>Kai Caster is very much in the same world as his girlfriend, Natalie Alyn Lind. Not only are they both actors, but they're both actors of roughly the same age in a very similar social circle in Los Angeles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kai is best-known for his work on The Baxters (where he played Dirk Bennet) and on American Horror Story. He also appeared in A Girl Named Jo and guest-starred on some of the most acclaimed series of the past few years, namely Shameless, House of Lies, Magnum P.I., and Yellowstone.</p><p>Given his low profile, very little else is known about Kai. Except that he has a knack for modeling, mixed martial arts, making music, and getting really close with Natalie.</p><h2 id=did-kai-caster-date-emily-alyn-lind>Did Kai Caster Date Emily Alyn Lind?</h2><p>This is the confusing part...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it certainly seems odd that Natalie would get into a relationship with a man who was tied to her younger sister, various sites do claim that<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Emily and Kai dated in the past</a>. However, they could have just been friends. Tabloids tend to only need a couple of photos of two hot young people to jump to conclusions. It doesn't help that Emily has been outlandishly secretive about the men she's been romantically linked to. Therefore any man she's been spotted or photographed with tends to become her 'boyfriend'.</p><p>Still, there are some rather cozy photos of Emily and Kai that suggest something happened between them. This includes a very sultry modeling shot from back in 2016.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then again, recent photos on Natalie's Instagram stories show all three of them together, putting more evidence in the 'Emily and Kai were just friends' camp.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything We Know About 'Big Sky' Star Natalie Alyn Lind's Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Regardless, there's no doubt that Emily and Kai had some sort of connection prior to him getting into a relationship with her old sister. Although it could've been a friendship.</p><h2 id=who-is-emily-alyn-lind-dating>Who Is Emily Alyn Lind Dating?</h2><p>As mentioned above, Emily has been extremely secretive about her romantic life. But photos prove that she was in a long-term relationship with musician Richard Edwards. We don't know if the couple is still together in 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given Richard and Kai's similar appearance, it could be that tabloids got the two men mixed up. But given his secretive Emily is about her romantic life, it seems as though we'll have to wait for her to give us more information about her mysterious love life.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Truth About ‘Gossip Girl’ Star Emily Alyn Lind’s Secret Boyfriend</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigrGWelsGiuMieZJqkqaN6rbXNnWSam6Sqrq242GabmqyZo7RutMSrZKyho6mys7%2BMnq9mmp%2Bus7O1xKebZqORnnqkrdKtnKtn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
