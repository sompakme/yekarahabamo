However, Barkley has ventured out since then, delving into various different avenues to diversify his interests that have made him a lot of money.</p><p>Barkley, nicknamed "Chuck," "Sir Charles," and "The Round Mound of Rebound" during his NBA days was a ferocious power forward that revolutionized the position. Though he was undersized by the standards of the day, Barkley's skills paved the way for smaller power forwards in today's game. Barkley has made a great career for himself and has made a lot of money along the way.</p><p>Barkley became an All-Star caliber player during his time with the NBA. He was also selected to the All-NBA First Team five times. Barkley's performance on the court was rewarded with big contracts. Barkley, however, made a big chunk of his money from commercials and endorsements for various brand names. Those endorsements and commercials allowed Barkley to transition seamlessly from the NBA to being an analyst on the Emmy Award-winning show, Inside the NBA.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On Inside the NBA, Barkley became a household name and a recognizable face on television. His unfiltered style of commentary often brings humor and some controversy. Barkley's 24 years on Inside the NBA have brought him fame, financial gain, and a slew of endorsement deals and small acting roles throughout his career as an analyst. All of which are just a small insight as to how Charles Barkley has made his massive $60 million net worth.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/charles-barkley-s-friendship-with-tiger-woods-came-crashing-down-after-these-comments-front-back-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Charles Barkley's Friendship With Tiger Woods Came Crashing Down For These Reasons</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Charles Barkley believes there are specific reasons why he and Tiger Woods are no longer friends.</span><p><strong>Updated January 2024:</strong>Charles Barkley signed a 10-year contract with TNT to continue his time on 'Inside the NBA'. However, according to Barkley, there is no way that he will finish out his contract with the network. This is because Barkley has claimed over the years that he wanted to retire at the age of 60. Given that Barkely is now 60 years old, he might not remain on TNT much longer. But given his $60 million net worth, leaving 'Inside the NBA' will not cause a detriment to Barkley's fortune.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=charles-barkley-begins-nba-career-with-the-philadelphia-76ers><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Charles Barkley Begins NBA Career With The Philadelphia 76ers</span></h2><h3 id=charles-barkley-made-9-million-with-the-philadelphia-76ers>Charles Barkley made $9 million with the Philadelphia 76ers</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/instar50057316-1.jpg><ul><li><strong>Barkley's NBA career started with the 76ers</strong></li></ul><p>Barkley was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers in 1984.
