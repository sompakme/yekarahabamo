In July 2020, they announced they were going their separate ways.</p><p>“We believe that we were put into each other’s lives for a divine reason and have both changed each other infinitely for the better,” <a href=#>the duo said in a joint statement</a> at the time. “The love we have for each other goes far beyond the relationship we’ve shared as husband and wife. It’s a soul connection that can never be erased. … We hold no blame, anger or contempt for each other and we ask for privacy and positive wishes for us both as we learn how to navigate through this.”</p><p>According to their filing, which was obtained by Us Weekly, the pair asserted that they “still have love and respect for one another.” <a href=#>Musgraves cited “irreconcilable differences”</a> as the reason for the split.</p><p>Two months later, the singers’ divorce was made final. A source told Us at the time that while Musgraves “was the one who initiated” the separation, <a href=#>she was “really upset”</a> about the end of her marriage.</p><p>The “Butterflies” artist didn’t <a href=#>publicly address the breakup</a> until February 2021, telling Rolling Stone that there’s a small part of her that “questions marriage as a whole, in general.”</p><p>She added, “I mean, I was open to it when it came into my life. I embraced it. I just have to tell myself I was brave to follow through on those feelings.”</p><p>Several months after breaking her silence, Musgraves revealed that she felt a shift in her relationship during the coronavirus pandemic. While she was thriving in her career, <a href=#>things were different at home</a>, causing a number of questions to form in her mind.</p><p>“Why did I make these decisions? How did I get here?” she recalled wondering in the June/July 2021 issue of Elle. “How can I prevent myself from getting there again? Why do I keep choosing the same kind of people?”</p><p>Though marriage might not be for her, the seven-time CMA Award winner has let herself fall in love again. She was briefly linked to <a href=#>Nashville-based doctor <strong>Gerald Onuoua</strong></a> before going public with <a href=#>boyfriend <strong>Cole Schafer</strong></a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Life is so much prettier with you in it,” the “Space Cowboy” singer <a href=#>gushed in an Instagram comment</a> after the writer shared a handful of black-and-white PDA pics in August 2021.</p><p>Scroll down to see Musgraves’ most candid quotes about life and love after her divorce:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuKKvxLJkpq2jnL%2BiwsSsZKqtn6mytHnAm6aurF2htqexjJqdrZ2iYr%2B2v9OopWajlaG5unnSqaOirF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
