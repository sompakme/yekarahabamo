She’s in New York City. She’s taking me for a long bike ride.”</p><p>The New Jersey native told guest anchor <strong>Dagen McDowell</strong> that he had a “great” holiday, but was more focused on reopening a portion of his restaurant, Joanne Trattoria, located on New York City’s Upper West Side.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Lady-Gaga-Gave-Her-Dad-a-Box-of-Oreos-for-Fathers-Day-02.jpg><p>Though the city was once the national epicenter for the <a href=#>coronavirus pandemic</a>, it entered phase two on Monday, meaning restaurants, many of which have been completely shuttered for months, can now open for outdoor dining. “It was a great day, [but] we had to work because it was kind of a scramble,” Germanotta said.</p><p>The restaurateur revealed that he initially closed his eatery, which counts Gaga, 34, as an investor, for two weeks and used the downtime to “clean up” the space. After getting a loan from the federal government — “a godsend” — Germanotta was able to give some of his staff their jobs back, explaining, “I hired back my key employees … some of them have been with me for eight, nine years, so I needed to take care of them.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Prior to getting the federal loan, Germanotta said he paid his employees out of his own pocket. However, the businessman came under fire in March after he <a href=#>set up a Go Fund Me for his staff</a>. Given his oldest daughter’s financial status — Gaga is worth is an estimated $275 million — critics felt the fundraiser was unnecessary. Germanotta subsequently shut it down.</p><p>Now that Joanne Trattoria can serve about 40 patrons at a time via two separate outdoor areas, Germanotta is hoping his business can bounce back. “If I can turn the tables a couple of times, I should be able to break even. It’s a matter of the people coming out,” he told McDowell, 51. “I happen to think there’s some pent-up demand to get out to restaurants, get out of the house. I think people have money. The consumers have been socking it away. They’ve been eating at home and cooking at home.”</p><p>For her part, Gaga organized the <a href=#>One World: Together at Home Coronavirus Benefit Concert</a> in April. The event, which included performances from the “Rain on Me” singer as well as <a href=#><strong>Elton John</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Billie Eilish</strong></a> and more, raised more than $127 million for those in need.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZqWZlK56qK3GmmSgmaaaeqmx0Wabmpxdlnqju9dmpp9ln6eysL%2BMn6arZZaWwamx0axknZmpZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
