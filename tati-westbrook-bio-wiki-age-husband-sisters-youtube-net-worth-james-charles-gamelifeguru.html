It read:</p><p>Tati, however, remained silent and didn’t publicly comment on this.</p><p>In her video, Tati mentioned that James said he doesn’t feel “comfortable” promoting Halo Beauty on his channel because he doesn’t want to promote supplements to his young audience. But he then went and did a deal with Sugar Bear Hair.</p><p>Tati said that she felt “used” because she and her husband have negotiated deals on James’ behalf, have mentored James, and have nurtured James.</p><p>She also said that another reason she did want anything with James is that he had been spreading lies about her.</p><p>She ended the video saying that this isn’t something she’s happy about or wanted to make public but felt like she had to because she didn’t want anything to be misconstrued.</p><h1 style=text-align:center>Frequently Asked Questions About Tati Westbrook</h1><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-tati-westbrook></span>Who is Tati Westbrook?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tati is an American YouTuber.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-tati-westbrook></span>How old is Tati Westbrook?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Westbrook is 37 years old as of 2019,</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-tall-is-tati-westbrook></span>How tall is Tati Westbrook?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Westbrook stands at a height of 5 Feet 7 inches.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-tati-westbrook-married></span>Is Tati Westbrook married?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She is married to longtime&nbsp;boyfriend James Westbrook.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-much-is-tati-westbrook-worth></span>How much is Tati Westbrook worth?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Westbrook has an estimated net worth of around &nbsp;$6 million USD.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-much-does-tati-make></span>How much does Tati make?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The YouTuber has been uploading 5 videos per week.
