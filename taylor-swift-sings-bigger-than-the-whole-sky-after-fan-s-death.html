There’s very little information I have other than the fact that she was so incredibly beautiful and far too young.”</p><p>The singer further explained that she would be unable to speak about the tragedy on stage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Taylor-Swift-Appears-to-Honor-Late-Fan-With-Emotional-Surprise-Song-Choice-3.jpg><p>“I feel overwhelmed by grief when I even try to talk about it,” Swift wrote on Friday. “I want to say now I feel this loss deeply and my broken heart goes out to her family and friends. This is the last thing I ever thought would happen when we decided to bring this tour to Brazil.”</p><p>Local concert organizer <a href=# rel=noopener>Time For Fun confirmed</a> on Saturday, November 18, that Machado had died at age 23 ahead of Friday’s show.</p><p>“Last night, Ana Clara felt unwell and was promptly attended to by the team of firefighters and paramedics, being taken to the Estádio Olímpico Nilton Santos [on-site medic] for first aid protocol,” the statement, which was posted in Portuguese, read. “Given the situation, the medical team chose to transfer her to Salgado Filho Hospital, where, after almost an hour of emergency care, she unfortunately died.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Taylor-Swift-Appears-to-Honor-Late-Fan-With-Emotional-Surprise-Song-Choice-2.jpg><p>Machado’s official cause of death has yet to be revealed.</p><p>In the wake of Machado’s passing, her father, <strong>Weiny Machado</strong>, <a href=#>shared a statement</a> to local newspaper Folha de São Paulo on Saturday.</p><p>“I lost my only daughter, a happy and intelligent girl,” he said. “She was about to graduate in Psychology next April, saving money. I have no words to express my pain. She left home to fulfill a dream and came back dead.”</p><p>Swift kicked off the South American leg of the Eras Tour earlier this month and has been forced to postpone two shows — something that is unheard of for the singer — due to various unsafe conditions.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Initially, she postponed the November 10 show in Argentina following “<a href=#>truly chaotic</a>” weather. A week later, Swift was forced to postpone Saturday’s Rio de Janeiro show “due to <a href=#>extreme temperatures</a>.”</p><p>“The safety and well-being of my fans, fellow performances and crew has to and always will come first,” she wrote via Instagram Stories at the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatmamhvLN50rCgn6xdqLavs9JmmaKfl5q%2FbsDHmqVmrJiaeri0zqWcZqubrnqistOeqWaekaPAbrDEmquhZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
