Because who wants to risk having their sex tape leaked?</span></p><p>“Masturbate in front of the mirror,” she told Chyna, 28, and sex therapist <b>Dr. Chris Donaghue</b>. “I’m the queen of that. … I highly suggest it, by the way. Just go home and masturbate in the mirror. It’s f–king amazing. You should try it.”</p><p><span>Despite her NSFW hobby, the stripper turned TV personality revealed that she isn’t as sex-crazed as fans might think.

I don’t feel an urge.”</p><p><span>While she may not feel an urge to hit the sack with a special someone on a regular basis, the model recently curbed her curiosity by trying out a threesome — an experience that she deeply regretted.</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><span class=caption></span><p><span>“We kinda just got together. It was a guy and a girl and it was f‑‑king horrible,” Rose admitted on last week’s edition of her podcast. “It was the worst. I am literally having sleepless nights.… I felt the pressure, getting older, to experience new things and I did it against my better judgment because I talk about sex a lot.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapZKav26%2BzqycZqSfq7K0ecyaqq2topeutbXNoGSipl2bv7C602amn2WknbJuucirqaiqXayBdXyQcm9o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
