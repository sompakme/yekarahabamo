The father and husband, whose real name is Ben Fodor, was arrested for assault because he pepper-sprayed party goers. Jones claims the people were fighting but the folks in question claim they were attacked.</p><p>Fodor appeared in court Friday to find out if he will face charges over the incident, the <a href=# id=auto-tag_seattle_2 data-tag=seattle>Seattle</a> Times reports.</p><p>He is the leader of a group of self-proclaimed “superheroes” called the “Rain City Superhero Movement” (RCSM). Jones even took off his shirt to reveal his signature black and yellow costume after the hearing was over.</p><p>The official police report on the incident says the partygoers were not fighting, but walking to their car “dancing and having a good time.”</p><p>Fodor spent about seven hours behind bars before posting $3,800 bail.</p><p>The RCSM leader, has been fighting crime on Seattle streets since February. He has previously been credited with preventing a carjacking but he also got into trouble as his <a href=#>nose was broken</a> in another incident.</p><p>We were going to talk about how insane he is and how dangerous this behavior is for his wife and kids but guess what? Jones is actually married to another member of the RCSM. She calls herself PurpleReign.</p><p>Um…ok.</p><p>Despite being advised against vigilante justice and the fact that people know his face now, Fodor states:</p><p>“I will continue to patrol with my team, probably tonight. … In addition to being Phoenix Jones, I am also Ben Fodor, father and brother. I am just like everybody else. The only difference is that I try to stop crime in my neighborhood and everywhere else.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6iyosDTpZxmq6WlsrO0xKumZqiYpLKvtddmoaimlah6trrMmqqknZRisLDB0a1kb3FlaIFw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
