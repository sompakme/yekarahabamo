Rowling Net Worth" href=#>JK Rowling's</a> wizarding world has enticed children and adults alike, with its magic. The truest fans have read and re-read every book in the series and made it to the opening night for the release of each film. But sometimes, the books and movies just aren't enough. Those who want to bring a little bit of wizadry into their homes, or venture into the land of Hogwarts, Diagon Alley and the like can dig deep into their pockets to do so. Replicas of magical objects can cost hundreds of dollars, and theme parks and tours are not cheap. You can always check out a book from your local library to quell your Harry Potter obsession, but if you have lots of money to dedicate to the cause, check out these expensive Harry Potter allures.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-warner-brothers-studio-tour>10) Warner Brothers Studio Tour</h2><p>via todayonline.com</p><p>Located&nbsp;just outside of London, the Warner Brothers Studio features real sets, props and costumes from the Harry Potter films. Fans get to walk though the Great Hall and Diagon Alley and peer into Snape's potion lab, the Gryffindor dormitory and Dumbledore's office. You can take pictures next to the life-size Knight Bus and the Dursley's Home on Privet Drive. For one adult, the tour costs 31 pounds, which is equivalent to approximately $52.00. Of course, those who are not from London will have to book flights and hotels in addition to the tour. And people do come from all over the world to check out the authentic Harry Potter experience that only Warner Brothers can offer.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-replica-harry-potter-glasses>9) Replica Harry Potter Glasses</h2><p>via fanpop.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you're looking for an expensive touch for your Halloween costume, you might want to purchase a replica of Harry Potter's trademark round glasses. However, the "Harry Potter Shop" warns that these glasses are a collector's item for display only, so you might want to think twice before wearing them on your face. The glasses come in a lined, wooden box, which can sit neatly on display in your living room for only $59.95.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-universal-orlando-s-wizarding-world-of-harry-potter>8) Universal Orlando's Wizarding World of Harry Potter</h2><p>via panoramio.com</p><p>Located at Universal Orlando, the Wizarding World of Harry Potter is a theme park that every muggle (who wishes they weren't) should visit at least once. Park guests can walk through Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade, and enter shops like Honeydukes and Weasley's Wizard Wheezes. Rides include the family friendly coaster, Flight of the Hippogriff and the 3D adventure ride, Escape from Gringotts. After a long day, grab a butterbeer at the Hog's Head or some traditional English grub at the Three Broomsticks. One Harry Potter-filled day is $136 for an adult, but one day usually isn't enough to take in the whole experience. The average Joe better start saving up their Galleons if they want to take their family vacation here.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-replica-sword-of-gryffindor>7) Replica Sword of Gryffindor</h2><p>via ew.com</p><p>In the second Harry Potter novel,&nbsp;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the sorting hat presents Harry with the Sword of Gryffindor to help him slay the&nbsp;basilisk. The sword also appears later in the series when Harry needs to destroy Voldemort's horcruxes. If you want a sword just like the one from the movies, it can be yours for $195.95. The handle of the sword is intricately designed and embedded with red crystal&nbsp;cabochons, but it comes "permanently" attached to a wooden display, so this isn't for the Harry Potter fan who wants to use the Sword of Gryffindor at his next fencing class.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-replica-time-turner>6) Replica Time Turner</h2><p>via thefilmcell.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In&nbsp;Harry Potter and the&nbsp;Prisoner&nbsp;of Azkaban, Hermione makes use of a time turner to take several classes at once, and at the end of the book, her, Ron and Harry use it to save Buckbeak's life and rescue Sirius Black. If the third novel is your favorite of the series, you might want a time turner of your own, for a mere $224.95. The sterling silver pendant has rotating rings with a real hourglass in the center, and comes with a chain and display box. The only thing it doesn't include is the actual ability to time travel.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-replica-firebolt-broomstick>5) Replica Firebolt Broomstick</h2><p>via beetlej.page.tl</p><p>As the star seeker on Gryffindor's quidditch team, Harry Potter was gifted a Firebolt from his Godfather, Sirius Black. The Firebolt was the fastest broom ever at the time that Harry received his. It's made with a handle of ebony, goblin-made iron, and birch or hazel twigs. It's also guaranteed to never break, as each Firebolt is charmed with an unbreakable spell. The Firebolt at the Harry Potter Shop can't promise all that, but for $294.95, you can have a full-sized replica to hang on the wall. Just make sure your family knows not to sweep the floor with it.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-replica-chess-set>4) Replica Chess Set</h2><p>via amazon.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the final scenes of&nbsp;Harry Potter and the&nbsp;Sorcerer's&nbsp;Stone,&nbsp;Harry, Ron and Hermione have to get past a life-size chess set in order to save the sorcerer's stone from Voldemort. Although this replica isn't life-size, it has incredibly detailed figurines that are miniaturized versions of those in the movie. With a plexiglass board and die-cast zinc pieces, this 'final challenge' Harry Potter chess board could be yours for $395.95.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-book-set-on-the-production-of-each-film>3) Book Set on the Production of Each Film</h2><p>via minalimablog.com</p><p>Harry Potter: Page to Screen: The Complete Filmmaking Journey&nbsp;is a set of books that goes behind the scenes of the production of the eight Harry Potter movies. Each book includes exclusive photos from set, and details on how the films were made. Along with the treasure trove of information, each book is designed to physically resemble a textbook from the films, including the infamous Monster Book of Monsters. The books come with a cloth-lined shelf for safe, and aesthetically pleasing, storage. With only 3000 sets having been made, it won't be easy to find one, and if you do, be prepared to shell out $1000 to have it as your own.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=2-harry-potter-tour-of-england>2) Harry Potter Tour of England</h2><p>via youtube.com</p><p>This two day tour of England through "Brit Movie Tours" will give Harry Potter fans their fix of magic for 1630 pounds (that's 2700 USD) per pair. The tour begins at Lacock village, which provided the setting for Professor Slughorn's house, Goddrics Hollow and Quirrell and Snape's classrooms. After lunch, the tour heads to&nbsp;Gloucester Cathedral, which you might recognize as part of the background for the Gryffindor common room and the wall in which "enemies of the heir beware" was written in blood, in&nbsp;The Chamber of Secrets. After the cathedral, the tour visits an owlery where you can get up close to the birds themselves. On the second day, the tour starts at Oxford, which houses Hogwarts' grand staircase and hospital, the quad where Malfoy is turned into a ferret, and the hall where the students learned to dance for the Yule Ball. The tour finishes up at the Warner Brothers Studio Tour.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=1-first-edition-prisoner-of-azkaban-with-typo>1) First Edition 'Prisoner of Azkaban' with Typo</h2><p>via harrypotterfanzone.com</p><p>If you thought the&nbsp;Harry Potter: Page to Screen book set was expensive, just wait until you hear about this. The first British editions of&nbsp;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&nbsp;were printed with an error - the copyright page had 'Copyright&nbsp;©&nbsp;Joanne Rowling' as opposed to 'J.K. Rowling.' The press corrected the mistake for the next printing, making the first edition with the error a rare and valuable collectible. If you want one of these first editions for yourself, be prepared to spend $10,000 for a like-new copy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e5BpZKano6l6psTPnqWsoaaaerW0yKeerGWRYrWivtGyZKmnpKmys3nFmqVmm5GjeqPB2Gg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
