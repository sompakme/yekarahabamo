Most affiliates (with any traffic source) are going to be running traffic straight to CPA offers via a landing page or direct link. As an affiliate, you can make great money with that strategy, but what are some of the other ways to leverage PPV traffic?</p><p><strong>Build an Email List</strong></p><p>PPV traffic is a great way to build an email list. You can collect emails for as little as $0.01 per opt-in and market to that list over and over. Instead of sending that customer off to your CPA offer for a flat commission anywhere from $1-$30, you can market multiple offers to that customer which could end up netting you hundreds of dollars in commission. Remember, once you collect the customers email address, it doesnâ€™t cost you any more to mail them more offers. You can accomplish this by building a landing page with your opt-in form on it using a program like Aweber. Offer your customers something in exchange for their email address. For example, if you are promoting a weight loss offer you might offer thenÂ&nbsp; a free report like â€œThe Top 10 Mistakes To Avoid When Dietingâ€ which they will get after they opt-in to your email list.</p><p><strong>Pre-Populate</strong></p><p>Why not send the traffic to an offer page with their info already filled out? All they have to do is click submit, and you get a commission. You can even pre-populate the offer and collect the email address to market to later. Sounds pretty good right? You will have to check with your affiliate network can see which offers can be pre-populated and the specific instructions on how to do that. Usually it just requires something to be added to the end of your affiliate link. If you want to also collect the email in your autoresponder like Aweber, you will need some additional code to send their email to your offer and Aweber.</p><p><strong>Incentivize Offers</strong></p><p>It can be hard to find incentive offers that work well but you can combine these with PPV traffic to really increase conversions.Â&nbsp; You will have to follow the rules as far as what you are able to incentivize with but since the traffic on PPV networks is relatively cheap, itâ€™s possible to get a lot of views to your page. To accomplish this find some offer that you think might do well and build aÂ&nbsp; landing page highlighting what the customer will get (the incentive) if they fill out your offer. If you are paying attention, you will realize this is another great opportunity to collect their email!</p><p><strong>Promote Your Own Product</strong></p><p>There is really nothing stopping affiliates from making their own product. You might think you need a lot of capital, resources, etc. but in reality your own product could be something simple like an ebook or an audio/video download. Take a subject you know like playing the guitar, gardening, or anything else and write a short guide about it. You will be surprisedÂ&nbsp; when it actually sells!</p><p>PPV traffic is fairly cheap and there is a lot of it. The key to monetizing this traffic is to think outside the box. Everyone is sending traffic straight to offers, so what can you to do be different and compete with all the other affiliates? Donâ€™t be afraid to try new strategies and ideasâ€¦you never know what will work until you try.</p><p>David Ford will be doing an 8 week live PPV webinar series with Corey Bornmann from Affportal taking students through these techniques and much more.
