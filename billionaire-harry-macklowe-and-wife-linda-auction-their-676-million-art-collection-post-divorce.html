The 35 pieces by world-renowned artists like Pablo Picasso, Andy Warhol, and Cy Twombly are some of the most expensive art collections to ever sold.</p><p>Two of the <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">most prized pieces of work</a> include a painting by abstract painter Mark Rothko which fetched $82.5 million, and Jackson Pollock's Number 17, 1951, which sold for over $61 million to set a new record for the artist's work.</p><p><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Andy Warhol's</a> Nine Marilyn's silkscreen, made shortly after the actress Marilyn Monroe's death, sold for $48.5 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Amy Winehouse Auction Pulls In $4 Million, Including $250K For A Single Dress</a></span></p><p>"It's a collection that has never been moved or touched," said Gr√©goire Billault, chairman of contemporary art for Sotheby's, at a press event announcing the two-part auction in September. "Quite often, when we have collections for sale, a lot of it has been sold already, or some works are given to museums; others are given to members of the family."</p><p>In 2018 as part of <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their divorce proceedings</a>, a New York State Supreme Court ordered the pair to sell the collection.</p><p>The controversial ruling came after the pair could not agree on the value of the artworks. For instance, the pair differed in their valuations of Alberto Giacometti's existential sculpture La Nez by $30 million. A judge appointed an administrator to oversee the sale of the items and ordered them to split the profits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The collection, estimated to be worth only $400 million, toured several locations, including Taipei, Hong Kong, Paris, and London, before returning to New York.</p><p>At a virtual press event announcing the sale in September, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sotheby's</a> CEO Charles Stewart had called the Macklowe Collection "one of the most significant and museum-quality collections of modern and contemporary art ever to come to market," and noted the significance of the auction by concluding that "this sale will make history as the defining moments in the art market."</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>A Record-Breaking Auction Held By Phillips, In Association With Bacs & Russo, Raised $74.5 Million</a>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSvqrjLoqanmZmnsm60wKupsmWdlrCsuM6wnGaZnpl6uLXFnmSloZ6Zrm6t1JyroqeeYsGpscirZG9vZmK6qrjLoqanZZGnwW6vzqWjnpuknryvec%2Boqq1llJ7DsL7CnmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
