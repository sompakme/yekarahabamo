During the Houston Astros 11-3 victory over the Kansas City Royals, third base star Alex Bregman shaved his face during the game, and even though it worked wonders for his game, we still can’t help but be shocked by it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the first inning, Bregman popped out during his first at-bat, and he seemingly blamed it on the terrible mustache on his face, as he reappeared for his second AB in the second inning without it. He walked with the bases loaded to send in the Astros eighth run of the inning en route to a drubbing of the Royals, and it’s safe to say that it didn’t go past his teammates.</p><p>The announcers made note of the change during the game. Apparently, like many athletes, Bregman is superstitious. So, when he started the game with a fresh patch of fuzz on his upper-lip and things went sour, he made sure to change things up in a hurry. Obviously, there is no scientific proof that facial hair impacts the way one plays, however, mentally, making a minor change like that could be all a player needs to get his head back in the game.</p><p style=text-align:center><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>PREDICTING THE STARTING LINEUPS FOR THE 2018 MLB ALL-STAR GAME</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gerrit Cole was on the mound when everything went down, and afterward, he had these comments to pass on to Astros beat writer Brian McTaggart: “After the game? During? I had no idea. I don't pay attention to Alex's shaving habits in the middle of the game. I did like the mustache, I thought it played. It was Jeff Kent-esque. It was on top of his lip when he stabbed that soft liner in the first inning, which got us out of a jam. Personally, I'm a fan of the 'stache, but I guess it's been sent down. It's been DFA'd. We'll wait until it comes back.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So what do you guys think? Is this something you’ve seen before, or ever thought you’d see? Are the Astros as unstoppable this year as they were in 2017 en route to the franchises first World Series?
