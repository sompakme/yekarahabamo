But precious little information seems to exist about the yacht, and it is particularly scarce with respect to basic details like her home port and supposed owner.</p><p>Yet searches for the History Supreme lead to link after link ranking it as the most expensive yacht ever made, sidestepping obvious questions – such as ones about whether precious metals are compatible with prolonged exposure to corrosive seawater, or whether a vessel of her description could be seaworthy at all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thankfully, the maritime information hub <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BoatSafe.com has the scoop on this mysterious vessel</a>, first pointing out that every site listing "uses the same four images" – often a sign that a concept or CGI object has been mistaken for or falsely held out as real.</p><p>Almost all the other yachts on this list have left undeniable traces of their existence – registration information, dedicated Wikipedia entries, and details about their movements and ports of call.</p><p>As for the "four images" in total, that's uncommon for notable vessels, which are often photographed by boating enthusiasts and beachgoers when yachts are docked, boarded, or when they're seen near the shoreline while at sea.</p><p>In this particular instance, it's difficult to imagine a solid gold yacht criss-crossing the planet for well over a decade (after her supposed commission in 2011) and not appearing in at least one Instagram post.</p><p>The History Supreme is described as the most unusual and lavish yacht in history, but no verifiable evidence of her seems to exist anywhere; she is brag-worthy, but never bragged about.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As BoatSafe.com explains, the History Supreme has all the hallmarks of an internet hoax:</p><p>You may have heard that the most expensive yacht in history is called the History Supreme. As near as I’ve been able to figure out, that’s not true. Not because the alleged $4.8 billion yacht wouldn’t be the most expensive – that’s far more than the next most expensive yacht.</p><p>Instead, it’s not true because the History Supreme is not a real yacht. It doesn’t exist. But you wouldn’t know that from how the internet works.</p><p>BoatSafe.com raised questions about her rumored owner (an unnamed, wealthy man from Malaysia), pointing out that her supposed cost of $5 billion amounted to over a third of the richest man in Malaysia's net worth:</p><p>People have assumed that the owner would be a man named Robert Kuok, the richest man in Malaysia. His fortune is around $14.5 billion. If he was indeed the man who purchased this boat, it means he spent one third of all of his money on it. That’s a lot of money to invest in a single boat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even if an individual with $15 billion decided to spend $5 billion on the History Supreme, Boat Safe uncovered what looked to be firm evidence of a hoax, pointing out the four images "looked a lot like the Baia One Hundred, a yacht made by Italian yacht makers Baia in 2008."</p><p>BoatSafe.com contacted Baia, which confirmed the images were theirs, and introduced another excellent question – how could a solid gold yacht be buoyant?</p><p>Baia’s sales manager said those photos were stolen from their website and doctored. So they were not new photos of an altered boat, but altered photos of an old boat. Moreover, and this is crucial, he also pointed out what should have been obvious to anyone working in boating news. If Hughes added 110 tons of gold to the boat, how the heck was it staying afloat?</p><p>If anything, the History Supreme is a good reminder that not everything that glitters turns out to be gold, that not everything flashy or exciting on the internet turns out to be true, and that the world's most expensive yacht would generate photographic evidence of its existence.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Yacht's Purported Name:</strong></p></td><td><p>History Supreme</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Purported Valuation:</strong></p></td><td><p>"$5 Billion"</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Port Of Registration:</strong></p></td><td><p>Not Applicable</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Notable Features:</strong></p></td><td><p>Inability To Float, Impractical Specs</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Launched:</strong></p></td><td><p>Never Launched</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpqejqXqmxM%2Bepayhppp6uq3CoausZZmjerW0xGauqKqcmXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
