The reality star is known for her love of fancy fashion. And whenever she shares details of her Hidden Hills house, which she bought in 2015 when she was still married to <strong><a href=#>Kanye West</a></strong>, fans are totally fascinated by the way that she lives. <a href=#>Kim has a vegetable garden</a>, which is fun to see. But fans don't always like the design decisions that she makes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Kardashian posted a video</a> of how she did her house up for Christmas in November 2022, fans didn't agree with her decor choices, according to The New York Post. Kim said, “Look at how magical. In my bathroom, I always have plants out there, and there’s like a whole balcony and you can go through my shower [to] out there." Someone called it a "murder house" and many found it agree.</p><p>While not everyone agrees with Kim Kardashian's decor choices, she seems to love her house, which is full of neutral shades and doesn't include any bright colors. What expensive things does Kim Kardashian have in her home?</p><h2 id=kim-kardashian-has-a-fridge-freezer-with-diamonds-on-it><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Kim Kardashian Has A Fridge/Freezer With Diamonds On It</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/kim-instar.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>People are always fascinated by what celebrities eat. <a href=#>Kourtney Kardashian has followed the keto diet</a>. And Kim Kardashian loves the chopped salad from La Scala that features cucumbers, romaine lettuce, salami, mozzarella, artichoke heats, and sun-dried tomatoes.</p><p>While fans would expect the star to have an elegant and sophisticated kitchen, it turns out that it's a lot more over-the-top than people might think. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Kardashian has fancy kitchen appliances</a> that set her back quite a lot.

According to The Daily Mail, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West bought four gold toilets that cost $750,000. Gold toilets are definitely subjective.

It cost $600,000, which is definitely more than most people are going to spend on a couch. And it's absolutely more than most would spend on all of their furniture, combined.</p><p>The Latch also mentioned that if someone wants to purchase a couch and two chairs from this company, it will cost $1 million.
