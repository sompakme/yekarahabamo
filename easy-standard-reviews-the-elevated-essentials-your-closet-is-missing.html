You head to your closet in search of something easy but elegant, but all you come up with is that ratty old t-shirt you bought 10 years ago. The classic t-shirt, tank and pullover seem like they should be easy to come by, but finding something you’re comfortable in that still looks great is much harder than it should be.</p><p>Well, look no further. These key pieces are going to save your wardrobe by opening up endless, effortless possibilities. And trust us, you’re going to want to stock up on these. Luckily, EasyStandard makes that easy — when you buy three or more of any EasyStandard tee or tank, you get 15% off. That’s right, shop <a href=#>pre-made core and seasonal bundles</a> or make your own by adding three of any color to your cart to save on the perfect closet essentials.</p><p><a href=#>Discover the basics that will change the way you look.</a></p><h2>The Basic Tee You Didn’t Know You Needed</h2><p>If there’s one item that should be in abundance in your closet, it’s the basic tee. They can be worn with anything: that killer leather jacket, the printed skirt that’s impossible to match, the jeans you’ll never get rid of. Really, the beauty of a basic tee is you can dress it up or down — any way you want — and it will work for you.</p><p>But so many are ill-fitting and uncomfortable. That’s why EasyStandard put in the work to make <a href=#>the perfect cotton tee</a>.</p><p>The Chiyo offers a relaxed fit that drapes just beautifully. It’s got a true crew neckline — not one of those weird in-between cuts — and it’s the perfect length to wear either tucked-in or loose.</p><p>Made with 100% cotton jersey, it’s lightweight, breathable and versatile — basically everything you could want.</p><h2>The Scoop Neck Tank That Will Elevate Any Outfit</h2><p>Another staple piece is the <a href=#>scoop neck tank</a>. The deep-cut neckline accentuates your shoulders and collarbones, giving you the perfect excuse to put on that statement necklace you’ve been wanting to wear.</p><p>This versatile piece can be worn underneath a blazer or just by itself, and you will feel amazing all day.

The ribbing at the neck and arm openings cinches the shirt in all of the right places to fully flatter your figure.</p><p>Few tanks are breathable enough that you can wear them during any situation, but this is one of them.
