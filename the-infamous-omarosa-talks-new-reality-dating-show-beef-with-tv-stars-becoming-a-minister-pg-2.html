I know you can’t reveal the ending but are you really saying you’ve married someone from the show?</strong></span><span id=more-41854></span></p><p><span>That was my intention to find love. I went all the way in, one hundred percent [with this show.]&nbsp; The hardest part is not being able to be seen [in public] with the person that you ultimately chose. It’s been seven months since we’ve finished the show and we’ve [my new guy and I] have had to do some sneaking and creeping around because we can’t disclose who the winner is. So that’s been interesting.</span></p><p><span><strong>So what would say went wrong with your first marriage?</strong></span></p><p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong>My ex-husband and I married very young. I was 22; about to turn 23, he was in his early twenties. We were college sweethearts at Howard University and we had no clue what it took to make a marriage work. A benefit of recognizing that early enough was that we could decide amicably to go our separate ways. And we still have a good relationship.</span></p><p><span><strong>What does your ex-husband think of The Ultimate Merger</strong><strong>?</strong></span></p><p><span>He’s very supportive. He has a lot of work commitments, he’s an executor, and his schedule conflicted with when we were shooting the show. But had the circumstances been a little different he would have possibly been a surprise guest on The&nbsp;Ultimate Merger, that’s how supportive he is.</span></p><p><span><strong>How was finding a mate on a reality show with a television viewing audience different from the traditional route?</strong></span></p><p><span>I don’t think that’s it’s any different from speed dating, going on eharmony.com or going to a happy hour and meeting someone. I have a friend who went on a speed dating session, which is two minutes per person [she met her husband there] and she’s been married for eight years. Being in front of a camera is not that unusual for me because I’ve lived so much of my life in front of one. I had plastic surgery on camera (in a TLC plastic surgery special where Omarosa got breast implants and treated her mom to a few cosmetic procedures.) America has seen every part of me.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX567p63MqKysZZ%2BirrO70ppkrZmcoMBuusSwZKudkaG2tcWMnZitoZ6cerS0zrBkm52Vm3q1woysq5qqo2Kvpq%2FOpqCnn12itq%2B10q2cq2WgnHpzeZNqb25sXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
