The show followed the antics of eight housemates who lived together for sun and fun during the summers on the shores of the State of New Jersey. The popularity of the American show was copied with foreign versions in England as Geordie Shore, in Spain as Gandia Shore, and in Mexico as Acapulco Shore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the series was canceled, a reunion special of the show called Jersey Shore: Reunion Road Trip was aired during August 2017. The special was received well and garnered decent ratings, so recently another special was announced, which has already started filming in Miami. It is called Jersey Shore Family Vacation. It will air sometime during 2018. Miami was selected because it received the highest number of likes for the suggestions of different locations that were made by fans on social media.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E Online</a> reports that almost all of the original cast from the show will return to appear in Jersey Shore Family Vacation including Deena Nicole Cortese, Jenni Farley, who goes by&nbsp;<a href=#>JWOWW</a>,&nbsp;Vinny Guadagnino, Paul Delvecchio, Pauly D, Ronnie Ortiz-Magro, Nicole Polizzi—affectionately known as Snooki—and Mike Sorrentino, better known as The Situation.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>SECRETS THE JERSEY SHORE CAST WANTS TO KEEP HIDDEN</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Noticeably missing from that list is Sammi Giancola, who won't appear because she was worried how it might affect her current happy relationship with another man if she spent so much time with her ex-boyfriend, Ronnie.</p><p>There was some concern that The Situation would not be able to be in the filming for the television special due to his recent serious problems with <a href=#>tax fraud charges against him</a>. He pled guilty to the charges of tax fraud and <a href=#>faces up to five years in jail</a>.</p><p>Luckily, because of his guilty plea, he was able to break free temporarily from the legal troubles to participate in the “JS Family Vacay Show.” After The Situation got his personal situation under control, he arrived one day later than the rest of the cast. He had a nice welcome at the airport by other cast members who came to greet him and who were very happy to see him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of the funniest scenes that have already been shot include showing the women trying on very skimpy bikinis and thongs that are the typical fashion wear for women that want to show off ALL their stuff in South Beach, Miami. Not missing any excuse to party, the guys started chugging down beers soon after arrival.</p><p>To stir up the drama a bit more, the show’s producers invited along the significant others and families of the cast members. Some of these extended family members will be in the show. Others will be wreaking havoc off-camera for the obvious hilarious effects on the cast members as they deal with all the issues and confusion of having a “family” vacation.</p><p>Filming of Jersey Shore Family Vacation will continue for through February 2018 in Miami. Then, the show, according to a promo, will be coming “F-ing” soon. We can hardly wait.</p><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=#>REMEMBER THESE JERSEY SHORE HOTTIES?</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmm62qr3yrsdGsnLJlo528s7GMrJyroZWoeqetzKKjsmWmlrCiwMiopWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
