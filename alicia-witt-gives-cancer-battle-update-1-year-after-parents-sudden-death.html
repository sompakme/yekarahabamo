In June, the Dune star <a href=#>opened up about quietly undergoing cancer treatments</a> and why she chose to keep her health struggles private.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“For me, this was such a needed part of my healing – particularly given the horribly public tragedy that had happened in our family just as i was beginning my treatments,” she explained via Instagram at the time.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Hallmark-Actress-Alicia-Witt-Shows-Off-Hair-Growth-Amid-Cancer-Battle-1-Year-After-Parents-Froze-to-Death-679.jpg><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Four months prior to revealing her diagnosis, the Walking Dead alum announced that<a href=#> a relative found her parents, Robert and Diane Witt</a>, dead after performing a wellness check at their home.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>According to reports, the residence was visited by the fire department&nbsp;to check on the home’s air quality, but firefighters found no evidence of carbon monoxide or other dangerous gases. Alicia’s cousin called the police for help after the actress grew concerned for her parents, whom she hadn’t heard from in “several days.”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“I reached out to a cousin who lives close to my parents to check on them. Sadly, the outcome was unimaginable,” the Massachusetts native said in a statement at the time. “I ask for some privacy at this <a href=#>time to grieve and to wrap my head around this turn of events</a>, and this surreal loss.”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>In January, the Twin Peaks alum took to social media to break her silence surrounding the shocking loss.&nbsp;</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“It’s been a month since I got scared, not having heard back from them, and called to have them checked on, waiting, phone in hand, praying fervently that the next call would be from them, angry I’d gotten someone else involved,” she wrote at the time. “I am deeply grateful for the gift of having been able to quietly travel to Worcester earlier this month for a beautiful service and burial, to mourn and to celebrate them in total privacy. … Thank you, also, to all those who have reached out with your memories about my parents. They<a href=#> were brilliant educators, deeply kind, curious, intuitive, wise, young at heart, funny</a> — there will never be enough adjectives to describe them.”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>She continued, “They were a united, intertwined, indivisible force, determined to do things their own way. Knowing they had each other — battling them the way I would have had to in order to do this truly felt like it would have destroyed them. My heart is broken. And even if I could have had a crystal ball and looked into the future — if I could have said to them, ‘You are going to break my heart and the hearts of all who love you with a worst-case-scenario ending if you don’t let us help you’ — I still think they would have made the same choices.”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>One month later,&nbsp;</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Us Weekly</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0><a href=#> confirmed that Robert and Diane died from</a> “probable cardiac dysrhythmia” due to the cold weather.
